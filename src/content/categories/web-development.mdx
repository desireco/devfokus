Web Development covers the practical tools, patterns, and trade-offs that power modern applications.

## Core Areas

**Frontend Foundations**: Component-driven design, state management, SSR/CSR, hydration strategies, and accessibility.

**Backend Patterns**: REST/GraphQL APIs, auth, caching, queues, background jobs, and observability.

**Edge & Infra**: CDNs, serverless runtimes, edge functions, routing, and build optimization.

Ship faster with quality by aligning architecture, tooling, and development workflows.
