Database Architecture covers the principles and techniques for designing, implementing, and optimizing data storage systems that scale with your application's growth. Explore relational and NoSQL databases, data modeling approaches, and architectural patterns for efficient data management.

## Core Areas

**Data Modeling**: ER design, normalization, schema patterns, polyglot persistence, and data ownership boundaries.

**Performance Optimization**: Indexing, query tuning, partitioning, connection pooling, and caching strategies.

**Scalability & Resilience**: Sharding, replication, read replicas, failover, backup/restore strategies, and DR planning.

**Operational Excellence**: Monitoring, capacity planning, migrations, schema versioning, and governance.

Make informed decisions to keep your data layer performant and reliable at scale.
