Security Best Practices compiles actionable patterns to reduce risk, protect user data, and harden systems against common threats.

## Core Areas

**Identity & Access**: OAuth2/OIDC, token lifecycle, RBAC/ABAC, least privilege, and secret management.

**Input & Data Protection**: Validation/sanitization, cryptography basics, TLS, secure storage, and GDPR/PII considerations.

**Secure SDLC**: Threat modeling, code scanning, dependency hygiene, CI/CD hardening, and incident response.

**Architecture & Operations**: Network segmentation, boundary protection, logging, and zero-trust principles.

Build secure-by-default systems that evolve with your threat model.
