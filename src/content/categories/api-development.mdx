API Development focuses on creating reliable, secure, and scalable application programming interfaces that enable seamless communication between software systems. This category covers everything from foundational API design principles to advanced implementation patterns, security best practices, and performance optimization techniques.

## Core Areas

**Design & Architecture**: RESTful and GraphQL patterns, microservices, versioning, pagination, idempotency, and backward compatibility.

**Security & Authentication**: OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, API key management, rate limiting, input validation, and common vulnerability mitigation.

**Documentation & Standards**: OpenAPI specifications, human-readable guides, interactive examples, Postman collections, and testing workflows.

**Reliability & Performance**: Caching, circuit breakers, SLIs/SLOs, observability, and stress testing practices.

Whether you're building internal microservices or public APIs, this category provides the practical guidance to ship developer-loved APIs with confidence.
