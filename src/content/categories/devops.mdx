DevOps ensures your application delivery is safe, fast, and repeatable through automation, visibility, and feedback loops.

## Core Areas

**CI/CD**: Branching strategies, automated testing, canary releases, and progressive delivery.

**Infrastructure as Code**: Declarative configs, reproducible environments, drift management, and secrets handling.

**Reliability Engineering**: SLIs/SLOs, incident response, postmortems, and operational maturity models.

**Observability**: Logging, metrics, traces, and actionable alerts that support fast detection and remediation.

Build systems that are easy to change and resilient to failure.
