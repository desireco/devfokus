# Microservices Architecture

Build distributed systems with microservices patterns, service communication, and scalable architecture principles.

## Core Areas

- **Service Design**: Domain-driven design, service boundaries, and decomposition
- **Communication**: REST APIs, GraphQL, message queues, and event-driven patterns
- **Data Management**: Database per service, eventual consistency, and data synchronization
- **Deployment**: Containerization, orchestration, and service mesh
- **Monitoring**: Distributed tracing, logging, and service health monitoring
- **Resilience**: Circuit breakers, retries, and failure handling patterns
