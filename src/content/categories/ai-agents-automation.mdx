# AI Agents and Automation

Create intelligent agents and automated systems that can reason, plan, and execute complex tasks autonomously.

## Core Areas

- **Agent Architecture**: Multi-agent systems, agent communication, coordination patterns
- **Autonomous Decision Making**: Planning algorithms, reasoning engines, goal-oriented behavior
- **Workflow Automation**: AI-driven process automation, intelligent task orchestration
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Agent-human interfaces, handoff mechanisms, oversight systems
- **Agent Learning**: Reinforcement learning, adaptive behavior, continuous improvement
- **Integration & APIs**: Agent connectivity, external system integration, service orchestration
