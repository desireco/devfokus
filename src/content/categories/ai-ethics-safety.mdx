# AI Ethics & Safety

Develop responsible AI systems with ethical considerations, bias mitigation, and safety-first approaches.

## Core Areas

- **Bias Detection**: Identifying and mitigating algorithmic bias in AI systems
- **Fairness & Transparency**: Building explainable and fair AI models
- **Privacy Protection**: Data privacy, anonymization, and secure AI practices
- **Safety & Reliability**: Robust AI systems, failure modes, and risk assessment
- **Governance & Compliance**: AI regulations, audit trails, and ethical frameworks
- **Human-AI Interaction**: Designing AI that augments rather than replaces human judgment
