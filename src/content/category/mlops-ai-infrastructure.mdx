# MLOps & AI Infrastructure

Build robust, scalable infrastructure for machine learning operations, model deployment, and AI system management.

## Core Areas

- **Model Deployment**: Containerization, orchestration, and serving infrastructure
- **Model Monitoring**: Performance tracking, drift detection, and health monitoring
- **Model Versioning**: Experiment tracking, model registry, and version control
- **Pipeline Automation**: CI/CD for ML, automated training, and deployment pipelines
- **Scaling & Performance**: Load balancing, auto-scaling, and resource optimization
- **Data Management**: Feature stores, data versioning, and pipeline orchestration
