# System Design & Architecture

Design scalable, reliable systems with proven architecture patterns and distributed system principles.

## Core Areas

- **Architecture Patterns**: Microservices, monoliths, and hybrid approaches
- **Scalability**: Load balancing, caching, and horizontal scaling
- **Reliability**: Fault tolerance, redundancy, and disaster recovery
- **Performance**: Optimization strategies and bottleneck identification
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and secure design principles
- **Monitoring**: Observability, logging, and system health metrics
