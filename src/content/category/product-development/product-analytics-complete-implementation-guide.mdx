# Product analytics: Complete implementation guide

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Implement product analytics by choosing the right tool (Mixpanel, Amplitude, or PostHog), defining key events and properties, implementing tracking code, creating dashboards for core metrics, and establishing a regular review process. Start with basic user actions and gradually expand tracking as your product evolves.

## Key Takeaways

- **Start with core events**: Track user registration, key feature usage, and conversion events before expanding to detailed behavior analysis
- **Define metrics before implementation**: Identify your North Star metric and key performance indicators before setting up tracking
- **Implement data governance**: Establish naming conventions and documentation to maintain clean, actionable analytics data

## The Solution

Product analytics implementation involves systematically capturing user behavior data to understand how customers interact with your product, identify improvement opportunities, and make data-driven decisions. The process requires selecting appropriate tools, defining meaningful events to track, implementing tracking code, and creating dashboards that provide actionable insights for product development and business growth.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Select and set up your analytics platform**
   Choose between Mixpanel (enterprise features), Amplitude (advanced segmentation), or PostHog (open-source alternative) based on your budget and technical requirements.

2. **Define your tracking plan and events**
   Document all user actions to track, including event names, properties, and triggers. Start with 5-10 core events like 'User Signed Up', 'Feature Used', or 'Purchase Completed'.

3. **Implement tracking code across your product**
   Add the analytics SDK to your application and implement event tracking for all defined user actions, ensuring consistent data capture across web and mobile platforms.

4. **Create dashboards and establish review processes**
   Build dashboards for key metrics, set up automated reports, and establish weekly review meetings to analyze data and make informed product decisions.

## Common Questions

**Q: Which analytics tool should I choose for my startup?**
PostHog offers the best value for early-stage startups with its generous free tier and comprehensive features. Scale to Mixpanel or Amplitude as your needs grow more complex.

**Q: How many events should I track initially?**
Start with 5-10 core events that represent your user journey's critical moments. Expand gradually based on insights and questions that arise from your initial data.

**Q: Should I track page views or user actions?**
Focus on user actions and events rather than page views. Actions like 'Clicked Purchase Button' provide more valuable insights than passive page view data.
