**Q: Can I use free tools instead of paid ones?**
Free tools like Google Alerts, Ubersuggest (limited), and manual research can provide basic insights but lack the depth, accuracy, and efficiency of paid platforms.

Review competitor activities weekly for tactical insights, monthly for strategic analysis, and quarterly for comprehensive market positioning updates.

Start with Ubersuggest's free tier for basic keyword research, then upgrade to SEMrush's Pro plan ($119.95/month) as your budget allows for comprehensive analysis.
