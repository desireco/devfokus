# Product team structure: What works and why

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Effective product teams use cross-functional structures with dedicated product managers, engineers, and designers working in stable squads. Include product marketing, data analysis, and user research as shared services. Empower teams with clear goals, autonomy, and end-to-end responsibility for specific customer problems or business outcomes.

## Key Takeaways

- **Cross-functional squads**: Teams with PM, engineering, and design working together on specific problems outperform siloed structures
- **Stable teams**: Keep teams together long enough to develop domain expertise and working relationships (6+ months minimum)
- **Clear accountability**: Each team should own specific outcomes, not just features or tasks

## The Solution

Successful product team structures balance autonomy with alignment, combining cross-functional squads with shared services and clear governance. The optimal structure depends on company size, product complexity, and market dynamics, but consistently includes stable, empowered teams with end-to-end responsibility for customer problems and business outcomes.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Define your team model and squad structure**
   Choose between feature teams (own specific product areas), journey teams (own customer experiences), or matrix teams (shared resources) based on your product and organizational needs.

2. **Establish core roles and responsibilities**
   Define clear responsibilities for Product Managers (what and why), Engineering Leads (how), Designers (user experience), and Product Marketing (go-to-market) within each team.

3. **Create shared services and governance**
   Set up centralized functions for user research, data analytics, and platform engineering that serve multiple teams while maintaining consistency and efficiency.

4. **Implement team goals and metrics**
   Establish clear OKRs or success metrics for each team, ensuring alignment with overall company objectives while maintaining team autonomy and accountability.

## Common Questions

**Q: How big should a product team be?**
Aim for 5-9 people per squad (1 PM, 4-6 engineers, 1-2 designers). Larger teams become harder to coordinate, while smaller teams may lack diverse perspectives.

**Q: Should product managers report to engineering or product leadership?**
Product managers should report to product leadership (CPO/VP Product) to maintain strategic independence and focus on customer value rather than technical constraints.

**Q: When should I restructure my product teams?**
Restructure when teams consistently miss goals, customer problems span multiple teams, or organizational priorities shift significantly. Avoid frequent changes that disrupt team dynamics.
