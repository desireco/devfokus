# Machine Learning & AI

Implement intelligent systems with machine learning models, AI integration, and scalable deployment strategies.

## Core Areas

- **Model Development**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, and ML frameworks
- **Model Deployment**: MLOps, containerization, and serving infrastructure
- **Data Processing**: Feature engineering, preprocessing, and pipelines
- **AI Integration**: APIs, embeddings, and intelligent application features
- **Performance**: Model optimization, inference speed, and scalability
- **Ethics & Governance**: Responsible AI, bias detection, and model monitoring
