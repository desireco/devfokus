# Quick start guide to edge functions and serverless runtimes

## What is Edge Computing?

Edge computing brings computation closer to your users by running code in data centers around the world, reducing latency and improving performance. Edge functions and serverless runtimes allow you to execute code without managing servers, automatically scaling based on demand and charging only for actual usage. This approach is perfect for API endpoints, dynamic content generation, and real-time data processing.

## Why Should You Care?

Edge functions dramatically reduce response times by processing requests closer to your users. Instead of routing all traffic to a central server, your code runs in the nearest edge location, often cutting latency by 50-80%. Serverless runtimes eliminate infrastructure management, automatic scaling, and cost optimizationâ€”you only pay when your code executes.

## Before You Start

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript
- Familiarity with HTTP requests and responses
- Node.js installed on your development machine
- A cloud provider account (Vercel, Cloudflare, or AWS)

### What You'll Need

- Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Terminal or command line interface
- Git for version control
- API testing tool like Postman or curl

## Step-by-Step Tutorial

### Step 1: Choose Your Platform

**Vercel Functions** - Perfect for Next.js applications with seamless integration
**Cloudflare Workers** - Excellent for global edge deployment with best performance
**AWS Lambda** - Comprehensive serverless platform with extensive ecosystem

For beginners, start with Vercel Functions as they offer the smoothest developer experience and excellent documentation.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Project

Create a new project directory and initialize it:

```bash
mkdir my-edge-functions
cd my-edge-functions
npm init -y
npm install @vercel/node
```

Create your first function in `api/hello.js`:

```javascript
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from the edge!' });
}
```

### Step 3: Deploy Your Function

Install Vercel CLI and deploy:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

Your function is now live at `https://your-project.vercel.app/api/hello`

## Advanced Implementation Patterns

### API Endpoints

Create robust API endpoints with proper error handling:

```javascript
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  try {
    if (req.method !== 'GET') {
      return res.status(405).json({ error: 'Method not allowed' });
    }

    const data = await fetchExternalData();
    res.status(200).json(data);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
}
```

### Dynamic Routing

Handle dynamic routes with parameter extraction:

```javascript
export default function handler(req, res) {
  const { id } = req.query;

  if (!id) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'ID required' });
  }

  res.status(200).json({ id, message: `Item ${id}` });
}
```

### Environment Variables

Use environment variables for configuration:

```javascript
export default function handler(req, res) {
  const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;

  if (!apiKey) {
    return res.status(500).json({ error: 'API key not configured' });
  }

  // Use API key for external requests
}
```

## Platform-Specific Features

### Vercel Functions

- **Automatic scaling** from zero to millions of requests
- **Edge Network** with global deployment
- **Integrated caching** with automatic invalidation
- **Environment variables** for different deployment stages

### Cloudflare Workers

- **True edge computing** with 200+ locations worldwide
- **WebAssembly support** for high-performance computing
- **Durable Objects** for real-time collaboration
- **KV storage** for global data persistence

### AWS Lambda

- **Extensive integrations** with AWS services
- **Advanced monitoring** with CloudWatch
- **Multiple runtimes** beyond Node.js
- **Complex event sources** and triggers

## Performance Optimization

### Cold Start Reduction

Minimize cold starts with these strategies:

- Keep functions small and focused
- Use provisioned concurrency for critical functions
- Implement proper error handling to prevent retries
- Choose appropriate memory allocation

### Caching Strategies

Implement effective caching patterns:

- Use CDN caching for static responses
- Implement edge-side caching with TTL
- Cache database queries and API responses
- Use stale-while-revalidate patterns

## Common Questions

**Q: What's the difference between edge functions and traditional serverless?**
Edge functions run globally at the network edge, closer to users, while traditional serverless runs in specific regions. Edge functions offer lower latency but may have limitations on execution time and memory.

**Q: How do I handle databases with edge functions?**
Use edge-optimized databases like PlanetScale, Neon, or Upstash Redis. For traditional databases, implement connection pooling and consider using API endpoints that run in traditional serverless environments.

**Q: Can I run background jobs with edge functions?**
Most edge functions have execution time limits (typically 10-30 seconds), making them unsuitable for long-running background jobs. Use dedicated worker services or queue-based systems for background processing.
