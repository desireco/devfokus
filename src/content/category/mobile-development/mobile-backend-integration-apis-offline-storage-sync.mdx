# Mobile Backend Integration: APIs, Offline Storage, and Data Synchronization

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Build robust mobile backend integration by implementing REST APIs with proper error handling, GraphQL for efficient data fetching, SQLite/Room and Core Data for local storage, and conflict resolution strategies for data synchronization. Use background sync with WorkManager and URLSession background configurations, implement exponential backoff for failed requests, and create offline-first experiences that work seamlessly regardless of connectivity. This approach ensures 99.9% app reliability and smooth user experiences in poor network conditions.

## Key Takeaways

- **API Integration**: Use URLSession for iOS and Retrofit/OkHttp for Android with proper error handling and request/response patterns
- **Offline Storage**: Implement SQLite with Room for Android and Core Data for iOS with proper data modeling and migration strategies
- **Data Synchronization**: Create conflict resolution strategies, implement incremental sync with change tracking, and handle network state changes gracefully
- **Background Processing**: Use WorkManager for Android and URLSession background tasks for iOS to ensure data sync continues when app is backgrounded

## The Solution

Mobile backend integration requires handling various network conditions, offline scenarios, and efficient data synchronization between device and server. The offline-first approach ensures applications remain functional regardless of connectivity, providing excellent user experiences even in poor network conditions. Proper API integration with robust error handling and retry mechanisms creates resilient applications that can handle temporary network issues. Data synchronization with conflict resolution ensures data integrity across devices while maintaining optimal performance and battery efficiency.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Design Efficient API Integration Architecture**
   Implement comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status code handling, create request/response models with type safety, and establish retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.

2. **Implement Robust Offline Storage Solution**
   Design normalized database schemas with SQLite/Room and Core Data, implement proper data migration strategies, and create efficient query patterns for local data access.

3. **Create Data Synchronization Strategies**
   Implement conflict resolution algorithms for concurrent modifications, use change tracking for incremental synchronization, and handle offline queue management for deferred operations.

4. **Establish Background Processing and Sync**
   Configure background tasks with WorkManager and URLSession, implement intelligent sync scheduling based on network conditions and battery level, and create sync progress indicators for user feedback.

## Common Questions

**Q: Should I use REST or GraphQL for mobile APIs?**
Use GraphQL for mobile applications requiring efficient data fetching with limited bandwidth. Use REST for simpler applications or when maintaining existing backend infrastructure.

**Q: How do I handle data conflicts during synchronization?**
Implement last-write-wins for simple scenarios, operational transformation for collaborative editing, or custom conflict resolution strategies based on business logic.

**Q: What's the best approach for handling large datasets on mobile devices?**
Implement pagination, data compression, selective syncing based on user needs, and caching strategies for frequently accessed large datasets.
