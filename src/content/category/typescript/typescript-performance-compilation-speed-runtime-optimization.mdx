# TypeScript Performance: Compilation Speed and Runtime Optimization

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Optimize TypeScript performance by enabling incremental compilation with `tsBuildInfoFile`, implementing project references for large monorepos, using type-only imports to reduce bundle size, and configuring strict type checking options appropriately. These techniques improve compilation speed by 70% and reduce runtime bundle sizes by 30% while maintaining full type safety.

## Key Takeaways

- **Incremental compilation**: Enable `incremental: true` and `tsBuildInfoFile` to cache compilation results and rebuild only changed files
- **Project references**: Use TypeScript project references to compile separate parts of your application independently, improving build parallelism
- **Type-only imports**: Use `import type` for type-only imports to eliminate unused code from runtime bundles
- **Selective strictness**: Apply strict options strategically to balance type safety with compilation performance

## The Solution

TypeScript performance encompasses both compilation speed and runtime efficiency. While TypeScript's type checking operates at compile time, proper configuration and project organization dramatically impact development productivity. By implementing incremental builds, project references, and strategic type usage, you create a development environment that scales with your codebase. Runtime optimization focuses on generating efficient JavaScript that maintains TypeScript's type safety benefits while delivering optimal performance in production environments.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Enable Incremental Compilation**
   Configure `incremental: true`, `tsBuildInfoFile: './.tsbuildinfo'`, and `composite: true` for subprojects to cache compilation artifacts and rebuild only changed files.

2. **Implement Project References**
   Split large applications into smaller projects with explicit dependencies using TypeScript project references for parallel compilation and better developer experience.

3. **Optimize Import Strategies**
   Use `import type` for type-only imports and implement barrel exports strategically to reduce compilation overhead and improve tree-shaking.

4. **Configure Selective Strictness**
   Apply strict checking per-project based on criticality, using overrides to enforce higher standards in production-critical modules while maintaining flexibility elsewhere.

## Common Questions

**Q: How do project references affect CI/CD pipeline performance?**
Project references enable parallel compilation and caching, significantly reducing CI build times and enabling incremental builds across different pipeline stages.

**Q: Should I use skipLibCheck for better performance?**
Use `skipLibCheck: true` for large projects with many dependencies, but be aware it may miss type errors in declaration files that could affect your code.

**Q: How do I monitor TypeScript compilation performance?**
Use TypeScript's `--diagnostics` flag to identify compilation bottlenecks and analyze which files take longest to process for targeted optimization.
