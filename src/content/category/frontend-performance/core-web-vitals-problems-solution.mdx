# Core Web Vitals problems? Here's your solution

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Core Web Vitals measure real-world user experience through three metrics: Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). Optimize LCP by improving server response, resource loading, and rendering. Fix FID by reducing JavaScript execution time and breaking up long tasks. Solve CLS by properly sizing media and reserving space for dynamic content.

## Key Takeaways

- **LCP target: 2.5s**: Optimize server response (&lt;600ms), resource loading, and element rendering to meet the 2.5-second threshold
- **FID target: 100ms**: Reduce JavaScript execution time, use code splitting, and minimize main thread work to achieve 100ms input delay
- **CLS target: 0.1**: Always include width and height attributes on images and videos, avoid inserting content above existing content

## The Solution

Core Web Vitals are Google's user experience metrics that directly impact search rankings. The solution involves systematic optimization of loading performance (LCP), interactivity (FID), and visual stability (CLS). Start by measuring your current metrics using Google PageSpeed Insights or Lighthouse, then prioritize fixes based on the biggest performance gaps and their impact on user experience.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Measure Current Performance**
   Run Lighthouse audit and Google PageSpeed Insights to establish baseline metrics for LCP, FID, and CLS. Document your current scores and identify the biggest opportunities for improvement.

2. **Optimize Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**
   Improve server response time with CDN and caching, preload critical resources, optimize images with modern formats, and remove render-blocking JavaScript/CSS. Focus on the element that takes longest to load.

3. **Fix First Input Delay (FID) Issues**
   Reduce JavaScript execution time with code splitting, minimize unused polyfills, use web workers for heavy computations, and implement lazy loading for non-critical JavaScript. Break up long tasks into smaller chunks.

4. **Eliminate Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**
   Always include width and height attributes on images and videos, reserve space for ads and widgets, avoid inserting content above existing content, and use font-display: swap for custom fonts to prevent font-related layout shifts.

## Common Questions

**Q: What's the difference between LCP and regular page load time?**
LCP specifically measures when the largest content element becomes visible in the viewport, not when the entire page finishes loading. It's more user-centric and correlates better with perceived performance.

**Q: How do I fix CLS caused by third-party widgets?**
Reserve space for widgets using CSS containers with fixed dimensions, load them asynchronously after main content, and use intersection observer to load them only when scrolled into view.

**Q: Should I prioritize LCP over FID or CLS?**
Start with LCP as it impacts perceived loading speed most significantly, then address CLS as it directly affects user experience, and finally optimize FID which typically requires more advanced JavaScript optimization techniques.
