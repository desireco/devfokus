# Critical rendering path: Step-by-step guide

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Optimize the critical rendering path by minimizing critical resources, reducing their file size, and optimizing the order they load. Inline critical CSS, defer non-critical JavaScript, preload important resources, and eliminate render-blocking resources. Focus on getting above-the-fold content visible as quickly as possible while deferring everything else.

## Key Takeaways

- **Critical resources identification**: Use Chrome DevTools Coverage tab to identify which CSS and JavaScript are needed for initial render, typically 20-30% of your total resources
- **Resource prioritization**: Load critical resources immediately with high priority, defer non-critical resources, and use preload/prefetch hints to control loading order
- **Inline critical CSS**: Extract and inline only the CSS needed for above-the-fold content, load the rest asynchronously to prevent render-blocking

## The Solution

The critical rendering path is the sequence of steps browsers take to convert HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into pixels on the screen. Optimizing this path focuses on minimizing the time and resources needed to render above-the-fold content. The solution involves identifying critical resources, reducing their size, optimizing their loading order, and eliminating anything that blocks initial rendering while maintaining full functionality.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Identify Critical Resources**
   Use Chrome DevTools Coverage tab to analyze which CSS and JavaScript are used during initial page load. Record page load, then filter to show only used code to identify the critical subset needed for above-the-fold rendering.

2. **Extract and Inline Critical CSS**
   Use tools like Penthouse or Critical to extract CSS needed for above-the-fold content, inline this critical CSS in a &lt;style&gt; tag in the HTML head, and load the remaining CSS asynchronously using non-blocking techniques.

3. **Optimize JavaScript Loading**
   Defer non-critical JavaScript using defer or async attributes, split JavaScript into critical and non-critical chunks, and use inline JavaScript for critical functionality that must run immediately during page load.

4. **Implement Resource Hints**
   Add preload hints for critical resources (fonts, CSS, images), use prefetch for likely next-page resources, and implement dns-prefetch and preconnect for external domains to reduce connection latency.

5. **Optimize HTML Structure**
   Place critical CSS inline in the head, move non-critical CSS to the bottom of the body, ensure proper DOCTYPE and meta tags, and minimize DOM complexity to speed up initial parsing and rendering.

## Common Questions

**Q: How much critical CSS should I inline?**
Inline only the CSS needed for above-the-fold content, typically 10-20KB. Keep inline CSS under 14KB to avoid exceeding the first TCP packet limit. Anything larger should be loaded asynchronously.

**Q: Should I inline critical JavaScript too?**
Only inline JavaScript that's absolutely critical for initial page functionality, such as feature detection or critical event listeners. Keep inline JavaScript minimal (under 1KB) to avoid blocking HTML parsing.

**Q: How do I handle fonts in the critical rendering path?**
Use font-display: swap for custom fonts, preload critical fonts, and provide system font fallbacks to ensure text remains visible during font loading. Consider using system fonts for better performance.
