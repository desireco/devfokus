# Why should you use performance budgets in 2024?

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Performance budgets are essential because they prevent performance regressions, ensure consistent user experience across all pages, align team priorities around performance goals, and provide measurable targets for optimization. In 2024's competitive digital landscape, performance directly impacts user satisfaction, conversion rates, and search rankings, making performance budgets a business necessity rather than a technical luxury.

## Key Takeaways

- **Regression prevention**: Performance budgets catch issues before they reach users, maintaining consistent experience across all pages
- **Business impact**: Fast sites see 2x higher conversion rates and 2x higher user engagement compared to slow sites
- **Team alignment**: Budgets create shared performance goals across development, design, and product teams
- **Competitive advantage**: In 2024, performance is a key differentiator that directly impacts business success

## The Solution

Performance budgets solve the problem of gradual performance degradation that occurs as features are added and codebases grow. They provide quantitative limits for key metrics like bundle size, image weight, and loading times, ensuring that performance remains a priority throughout development. The solution involves setting realistic budgets based on user needs, implementing automated monitoring, and creating team processes that respect performance constraints.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Establish Baseline Metrics**
   Measure current performance across key pages using Lighthouse and WebPageTest. Document Core Web Vitals, bundle sizes, image weights, and loading times. Use this data to set realistic initial budgets that balance performance goals with feature requirements.

2. **Define Budget Categories**
   Create specific budgets for different resource types: JavaScript bundle size (e.g., 250KB compressed), CSS bundle size (50KB compressed), image weight per page (500KB total), and performance metrics (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1).

3. **Implement Automated Monitoring**
   Integrate performance budget checking into your CI/CD pipeline using tools like Lighthouse CI, webpack-bundle-analyzer, and custom size limits. Set up alerts when budgets are exceeded and prevent merges that violate performance constraints.

4. **Create Team Processes**
   Establish performance review processes for new features, require performance impact assessments for major changes, and create performance champions within each team. Make performance a factor in code reviews and product planning.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   Regularly review budget effectiveness, adjust targets based on user feedback and business goals, and celebrate performance improvements. Use real user monitoring data to validate that budgets translate to better user experiences.

## Common Questions

**Q: How do I determine the right budget numbers?**
Start with industry benchmarks and your current performance data. Consider your target users' network conditions and devices. Set ambitious but achievable targets, then tighten them over time as you optimize.

**Q: What if business requirements conflict with performance budgets?**
Performance budgets should inform feature decisions, not block them entirely. When conflicts arise, explore alternatives: lazy loading, code splitting, image optimization, or feature prioritization. Frame performance as a business requirement, not a technical constraint.

**Q: Should I have different budgets for different pages?**
Yes, establish different budgets based on page importance and user expectations. Homepages and landing pages should have stricter budgets than internal pages. Consider user journey context when setting targets.
