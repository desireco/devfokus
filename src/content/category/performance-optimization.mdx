Performance Optimization provides the tools and frameworks to make applications fast and efficient end-to-end.

## Core Areas

**Measurement & Goals**: Define SLAs/SLOs, adopt observability, create performance budgets, and track user-centric metrics.

**Backend Performance**: Profiling, caching, concurrency, efficient I/O, and GC tuning.

**Frontend Performance**: Bundle size management, SSR/CSR tradeoffs, hydration strategies, and image optimization.

**Infra & Networks**: CDN configuration, HTTP/2/3, connection reuse, and smart routing.

Turn performance into a product capability, not a one-off task.
