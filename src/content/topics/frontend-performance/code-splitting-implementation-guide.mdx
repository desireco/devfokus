# Code splitting: Complete implementation guide

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Code splitting divides your JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks that load on-demand, reducing initial bundle size and improving perceived performance. Implement route-based splitting for navigation, component-based splitting for heavy UI elements, and vendor splitting for third-party libraries. Use dynamic imports, React.lazy(), and webpack's SplitChunksPlugin for optimal results.

## Key Takeaways

- **Route-based splitting**: Split at the route level to load only the code needed for each page, reducing initial bundle size by 40-60%
- **Component-level splitting**: Apply to heavy components like charts, editors, or complex UI elements that aren't immediately visible
- **Vendor chunking**: Separate third-party libraries from application code to leverage browser caching and improve build times

## The Solution

Code splitting solves the performance problem of large JavaScript bundles that slow down initial page loads. By strategically dividing your code into smaller chunks that load only when needed, you significantly reduce the amount of JavaScript that must be downloaded, parsed, and executed before users can interact with your application. Modern bundlers like webpack and frameworks like React make implementation straightforward with built-in support for dynamic imports and lazy loading.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up Route-Based Splitting**
   Implement dynamic imports for each route in your application. In React, use React.lazy() with Suspense, or in vanilla JavaScript use dynamic import() statements. This ensures users only download code for the page they're visiting.

2. **Configure Vendor Chunking**
   Use webpack's SplitChunksPlugin to automatically separate third-party libraries into their own chunks. Configure cacheGroups to extract common vendors like React, Lodash, or UI libraries into separate bundles that benefit from long-term browser caching.

3. **Implement Component-Level Splitting**
   Identify heavy components (data grids, charts, rich text editors) and wrap them in lazy-loaded boundaries. Use intersection observer to load these components only when they're about to enter the viewport, further reducing initial bundle size.

4. **Optimize Chunk Loading Strategy**
   Implement prefetching for likely next routes, preloading for critical above-the-fold components, and lazy loading for everything else. Use webpack's magic comments (webpackPrefetch, webpackPreload) to hint the browser about loading priorities.

## Common Questions

**Q: How do I know what to split and what to keep in the main bundle?**
Keep critical above-the-fold functionality and shared utilities in the main bundle. Split routes, heavy components, and rarely used features. Analyze your bundle using webpack-bundle-analyzer to identify the largest modules.

**Q: Does code splitting affect SEO?**
Properly implemented code splitting doesn't negatively impact SEO. Search engines can execute JavaScript and discover dynamically loaded content. Use server-side rendering or static generation for critical content to ensure search engines can index it properly.

**Q: How many chunks should I create?**
Aim for 3-5 chunks per route level: main bundle, vendor chunk, route-specific chunk, and 1-2 feature-specific chunks. Too many chunks create HTTP overhead, while too few defeat the purpose of splitting.
