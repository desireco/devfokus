# Quick start guide to service worker caching

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Implement service worker caching by registering a service worker, defining caching strategies for different resource types, and managing cache lifecycle. Use cache-first for static assets, network-first for API calls, and stale-while-revalidate for dynamic content. This approach improves performance, enables offline functionality, and reduces server load.

## Key Takeaways

- **Caching strategies**: Use cache-first for static assets (CSS, JS, images), network-first for dynamic content (API calls), and stale-while-revalidate for frequently updated content
- **Cache management**: Implement version-based cache invalidation, set appropriate cache expiration times, and provide cache cleanup mechanisms to prevent storage bloat
- **Offline fallbacks**: Create offline pages and fallback responses to maintain user experience when network is unavailable

## The Solution

Service worker caching provides powerful performance optimization by intercepting network requests and serving responses from cache when appropriate. The solution involves implementing different caching strategies based on content type, managing cache lifecycle effectively, and providing offline fallbacks. This approach significantly improves load times for repeat visitors and enables offline functionality.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Register Service Worker**
   Add service worker registration code to your main JavaScript file, check for browser support, and handle update events. Use navigator.serviceWorker.register() with proper error handling and update management.

2. **Implement Caching Strategies**
   Define different strategies for various resource types: cache-first for static assets, network-first for API calls, and stale-while-revalidate for dynamic content. Use the Cache API to store and retrieve responses efficiently.

3. **Set Up Cache Management**
   Implement cache versioning using cache names with version numbers, create cleanup functions to remove old caches, and set appropriate cache limits to prevent storage quota issues.

4. **Create Offline Fallbacks**
   Design offline HTML pages, provide fallback images and icons, and implement offline API responses or cached data to maintain basic functionality when network is unavailable.

5. **Handle Service Worker Updates**
   Implement skipWaiting and clients.claim() for immediate updates, provide user notifications for available updates, and handle the service worker lifecycle properly to ensure smooth updates.

## Common Questions

**Q: How do I choose the right caching strategy?**
Use cache-first for static assets that rarely change (CSS, JS, images), network-first for dynamic content that must be fresh (API responses), and stale-while-revalidate for content that updates occasionally but can be served from cache.

**Q: How much can I cache?**
Browser storage limits vary but typically range from 50MB to several hundred MB per origin. Monitor cache usage and implement cleanup strategies to stay within limits. Use cache quotas API to check available storage.

**Q: Should I cache everything?**
No, avoid caching sensitive user data, large files that are rarely accessed, and rapidly changing content. Focus on caching static assets, frequently accessed resources, and content that benefits from offline access.
