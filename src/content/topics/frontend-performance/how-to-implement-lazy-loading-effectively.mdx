# How to implement lazy loading effectively?

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Implement lazy loading using the Intersection Observer API for images, videos, and components that appear below the fold. Set appropriate root margins to start loading before elements enter viewport, use placeholder content to prevent layout shift, and combine with responsive images and proper aspect ratios. For critical content, consider eager loading to maintain user experience.

## Key Takeaways

- **Intersection Observer API**: Modern, performant way to detect when elements enter viewport with better performance than scroll events
- **Root margin configuration**: Use negative margins (like "-100px") to start loading before elements become visible, preventing users from seeing loading placeholders
- **Placeholder strategy**: Use low-quality image placeholders (LQIP), skeleton screens, or solid colors to maintain layout stability and improve perceived performance

## The Solution

Lazy loading defers loading of non-critical resources until they're needed, significantly improving initial page load times and reducing bandwidth usage. The most effective approach combines the Intersection Observer API for viewport detection with proper placeholder management and fallback strategies for older browsers. This technique works for images, iframes, videos, and entire components, making it essential for modern web performance optimization.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up Intersection Observer**
   Create an Intersection Observer instance with appropriate threshold and rootMargin options. Use a root margin of "-100px" to start loading 100px before elements enter viewport, ensuring content loads before users see it.

2. **Implement Image Lazy Loading**
   Add data-src attributes to images instead of src, use srcset for responsive images, and implement fallback for browsers that don't support Intersection Observer. Include width and height attributes to prevent layout shift during loading.

3. **Create Component Lazy Loading**
   Wrap heavy components in lazy loading boundaries using React.lazy() or custom Intersection Observer logic. Load components only when they're about to enter viewport, and show loading states during the loading process.

4. **Add Progressive Enhancement**
   Implement native lazy loading with loading="lazy" attribute as a baseline, enhance with Intersection Observer for better control, and provide noscript fallbacks for users with JavaScript disabled. Ensure critical above-the-fold content loads immediately.

## Common Questions

**Q: Should I lazy load all images on my page?**
No, lazy load only images that appear below the fold. Above-the-fold images should load immediately to maintain perceived performance. Use the loading="eager" attribute for critical images and loading="lazy" for others.

**Q: How do I handle lazy loading with responsive images?**
Use srcset and sizes attributes with data-srcset and data-sizes, then swap them to srcset and sizes when the element enters viewport. This ensures the browser can select the appropriate image size based on viewport and device pixel ratio.

**Q: What's the impact on SEO and accessibility?**
Lazy loading doesn't negatively impact SEO when implemented correctly. Search engines can discover lazy-loaded content, and accessibility is maintained by ensuring all content is available when users interact with it. Use proper alt text and ARIA labels for lazy-loaded images.
