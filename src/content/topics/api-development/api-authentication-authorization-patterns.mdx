# API Authentication & Authorization Patterns

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Use OAuth 2.0 for third-party access, JWT for stateless authentication, API keys for simple server-to-server communication, and implement RBAC for fine-grained authorization. Always use HTTPS, implement token expiration, and include proper scope validation.

## Key Takeaways

- **Authentication vs. Authorization**: Authentication verifies who you are (OAuth 2.0, JWT), while authorization determines what you can do (RBAC, scopes)
- **Token-based security**: JWT provides stateless authentication with embedded claims, while OAuth 2.0 handles delegated access for third-party integrations
- **Principle of least privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions and use scopes to limit access to specific resources and operations
- **Defense in depth**: Combine multiple security layers including HTTPS, token validation, [rate limiting](/topics/api-rate-limiting-implementation), and audit logging

## The Solution

API authentication and authorization are critical for protecting your resources while enabling legitimate access. Authentication verifies the identity of clients, while authorization controls what they can access. Modern APIs use token-based approaches like JWT for stateless authentication and OAuth 2.0 for delegated access. The key is choosing the right pattern for your use case, implementing proper token management, and following security best practices like HTTPS, token expiration, and scope validation. A well-designed auth system provides secure access without compromising usability or performance.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Choose Authentication Method**
   Select OAuth 2.0 for third-party integrations, JWT for stateless authentication, API keys for simple server-to-server communication, or mTLS for high-security scenarios.

2. **Implement OAuth 2.0 Flow**
   Set up authorization server, define scopes, implement appropriate grant types (Authorization Code, Client Credentials), and handle token refresh properly.

3. **Configure JWT Implementation**
   Use strong signing algorithms (RS256), include necessary claims (sub, exp, iat, scopes), implement proper token validation, and manage key rotation securely.

4. **Design Authorization Model**
   Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with clear role definitions, resource-based permissions, and attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained control. For a deep dive into this principle, see our [Principle of Least Privilege](/topics/the-principle-of-least-privilege) guide.

5. **Set Up API Key Management**
   Generate unique API keys, implement key rotation policies, use key prefixes for identification, and track usage for monitoring and billing.

6. **Implement Security Middleware**
   Create authentication middleware for token validation, authorization checks for resource access, and proper error responses for auth failures.

7. **Add Security Monitoring**
   Log authentication attempts, monitor for unusual patterns, implement rate limiting, and set up alerts for security events.

## Common Questions

**Q: When should I use OAuth 2.0 vs. JWT?**
Use OAuth 2.0 when you need delegated access (third-party apps accessing user data) and JWT for direct authentication between clients and your API.

**Q: How do I handle token expiration and refresh?**
Implement short-lived access tokens (15-60 minutes) with refresh tokens (days/weeks) for better security, and provide secure token refresh endpoints.

**Q: Should I store tokens in databases?**
Store refresh tokens in databases for revocation capability, but JWT access tokens can be stateless if they include expiration and proper signing. For secure storage practices, see our [Best Practices for Securely Storing Passwords](/topics/best-practices-for-securely-storing-passwords) guide.
