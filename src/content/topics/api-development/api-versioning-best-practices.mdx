# API Versioning Best Practices

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Use URI versioning for public APIs (/v1/users), header versioning for internal services (Accept: application/vnd.api.v1+json), and maintain backward compatibility for at least 6-12 months. Document deprecation timelines clearly and provide migration guides for smooth transitions.

## Key Takeaways

- **Versioning strategy choice**: URI versioning works best for public APIs, while header versioning is cleaner for internal microservices
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintain old versions for 6-12 months with clear deprecation notices and migration paths
- **Breaking changes**: Only increment versions for breaking changes; use additive changes for non-breaking updates
- **Communication is key**: Provide advance notice, documentation, and migration tools to help clients transition smoothly

## The Solution

API versioning is essential for evolving your APIs without breaking existing client integrations. The key is choosing the right versioning strategy for your use case, maintaining backward compatibility, and communicating changes effectively. Different approaches work better for different scenarios - URI versioning is clear and cache-friendly for public APIs, while header versioning keeps URLs clean for internal services. Regardless of the approach, successful versioning requires clear deprecation policies, comprehensive documentation, and smooth migration paths that minimize disruption to your API consumers.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Choose Versioning Strategy**
   Select URI versioning (/v1/) for public APIs, header versioning (Accept header) for internal services, or query parameter versioning for simple cases.

2. **Define Versioning Policy**
   Establish clear guidelines for what constitutes breaking changes, version lifecycle (typically 6-12 months), and deprecation communication processes.

3. **Implement Version Detection**
   Create middleware or routing logic to detect and handle different API versions consistently across your application.

4. **Design Backward Compatibility**
   Use additive changes (new fields, new endpoints) for minor updates and reserve version bumps for breaking changes like field removal or behavior changes.

5. **Plan Deprecation Process**
   Implement deprecation headers, sunset dates, and automated notifications to inform clients about upcoming version retirements.

6. **Create Migration Documentation**
   Provide detailed migration guides, code examples, and tools to help clients transition between API versions smoothly.

7. **Monitor Version Usage**
   Track which API versions are actively used to inform deprecation decisions and support planning.

## Common Questions

**Q: How long should I support old API versions?**
Typically 6-12 months after deprecation notice, but this depends on your client base and industry requirements. Some enterprise APIs may need longer support periods.

**Q: Should I version all endpoints or only changed ones?**
Version the entire API rather than individual endpoints to maintain consistency and avoid confusion. Mixed versioning creates complexity for client developers.

**Q: How do I handle database changes with API versions?**
Use database migrations that support multiple API versions simultaneously, or implement data transformation layers to handle schema differences between versions.

## Tools & Resources

- **API Gateway** - AWS API Gateway, Kong, or Apigee for managing API versions with routing and throttling capabilities
- **OpenAPI Specification** - Document multiple API versions using OpenAPI 3.0 with proper versioning and deprecation markers
- **Postman** - Test and document different API versions with collections and environment variables
- **Swagger UI** - Generate interactive documentation for multiple API versions with clear version switching
- **Versioning Libraries** - Framework-specific libraries like Express Router, Django REST Framework versioning, or Spring Boot versioning
