# RESTful API Design Principles

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Design REST APIs around resources (nouns) not actions (verbs), use proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), return appropriate status codes, and implement stateless communication with consistent URL patterns and pagination for large datasets.

## Key Takeaways

- **Resource-oriented design**: Model your API around resources (users, orders, products) rather than actions, using nouns in URLs and HTTP verbs for operations
- **Proper HTTP semantics**: Use GET for retrieval, POST for creation, PUT for updates, DELETE for removal, and PATCH for partial updates
- **Stateless communication**: Each request should contain all information needed to process it, without relying on previous requests or server-side sessions
- **Consistent patterns**: Use consistent URL structures, naming conventions, and response formats across all endpoints for better developer experience

## The Solution

RESTful API design creates scalable, maintainable, and intuitive APIs by following architectural constraints that leverage HTTP's strengths. The key is thinking in terms of resources and their relationships, using HTTP methods correctly, and maintaining stateless communication. Good REST API design makes your API predictable, cacheable, and easy for developers to understand and use. When implemented correctly, REST APIs provide excellent performance, scalability, and developer experience through proper use of HTTP features, consistent patterns, and clear resource modeling.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Identify Resources**
   Model your domain as resources (nouns) with clear relationships, avoiding action-based URLs and focusing on what your API manages rather than what it does.

2. **Design URL Structure**
   Create hierarchical, consistent URL patterns using plural nouns (`/api/v1/users`, `/api/v1/users/{id}/orders`) and avoid deep nesting beyond 2-3 levels.

3. **Apply HTTP Methods Correctly**
   Use GET for safe retrieval, POST for creation, PUT for complete updates, PATCH for partial updates, and DELETE for resource removal.

4. **Implement Status Codes**
   Return appropriate HTTP status codes: 200 for success, 201 for creation, 204 for deletion, 400 for client errors, 401 for authentication, 403 for authorization, 404 for not found, and 500 for server errors.

5. **Design Request/Response Formats**
   Use JSON for request/response bodies with consistent field naming (camelCase or snake_case), include metadata for pagination, and provide clear error messages.

6. **Add Filtering and Pagination**
   Implement query parameters for filtering (?status=active), sorting (?sort=created_at), and pagination (?page=2&limit=50) for large datasets.

7. **Ensure Statelessness**
   Design each request to be independent, include authentication/authorization in headers, and avoid server-side sessions or state management.

## Common Questions

**Q: Should I use nouns or verbs in my API URLs?**
Always use nouns for resources (/users) and HTTP verbs for actions (GET /users, POST /users). Avoid action-based URLs like /getUser or /createUser.

**Q: How do I handle complex queries and filtering?**
Use query parameters for filtering (?category=electronics&price_min=100), sorting (?sort=price_desc), and field selection (?fields=id,name,email) to keep URLs clean.

**Q: What's the difference between PUT and PATCH?**
PUT replaces the entire resource (requires all fields), while PATCH updates only specified fields. Use PUT for complete updates and PATCH for partial modifications.
