# API Error Handling & Response Standards

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Use appropriate HTTP status codes (400 for client errors, 500 for server errors), return structured error responses with consistent format including error codes, messages, and details. Provide actionable error messages that help developers fix issues quickly.

## Key Takeaways

- **Proper HTTP status codes**: Use 4xx codes for client errors (400, 401, 403, 404, 422) and 5xx codes for server errors (500, 502, 503)
- **Structured error responses**: Return consistent JSON format with error code, message, details, and timestamp for programmatic handling
- **Actionable error messages**: Provide clear, specific error messages that help developers understand and fix the problem
- **Error documentation**: Include error codes in API documentation with examples and suggested solutions for common issues

## The Solution

Effective error handling transforms frustrating API experiences into productive debugging sessions. The key is using proper HTTP status codes, returning structured error responses, and providing actionable error messages that help developers quickly identify and fix issues. Consistent error handling across all endpoints creates predictable behavior that makes your API easier to use and debug. When implemented correctly, error responses should provide enough information for developers to understand what went wrong and how to fix it, while avoiding sensitive information exposure.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Define Error Response Structure**
   Create a consistent error response format with fields like error_code, message, details, timestamp, and request_id for tracking.

2. **Map HTTP Status Codes**
   Use 400 for bad requests, 401 for authentication, 403 for authorization, 404 for not found, 422 for validation errors, and 500 for server errors.

3. **Create Error Code System**
   Develop hierarchical error codes (USER_NOT_FOUND, VALIDATION_FAILED, RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED) that map to specific error scenarios.

4. **Implement Validation Error Handling**
   Return detailed field-level validation errors with specific messages about what failed and how to fix it.

5. **Add Error Logging**
   Log errors with context including request_id, user_id, error details, and stack traces for debugging and monitoring.

6. **Create Error Documentation**
   Document all error codes with examples, causes, and suggested solutions in your API documentation.

7. **Handle Global Exceptions**
   Implement global exception handlers to catch unhandled errors and return consistent error responses across all endpoints.

## Common Questions

**Q: How much information should I include in error responses?**
Include enough information for developers to debug the issue, but avoid exposing sensitive data or internal implementation details.

**Q: Should I use different error formats for different API versions?**
Maintain consistent error formats across versions when possible, but version error formats if you need to make breaking changes to the structure.

**Q: How do I handle errors in batch operations?**
Return overall operation status with detailed per-item error information, allowing partial success scenarios with clear error reporting.
