# An Introduction to DevSecOps: Integrating Security into Your CI/CD Pipeline

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

DevSecOps is a cultural and technical shift that integrates security practices into the [DevOps](/devops) lifecycle. Instead of treating security as a final gate before release, DevSecOps involves automating security checks and tests ...throughout the entire [CI/CD pipeline](/devops/an-introduction-to-cicd). This is often called "shifting security left"â€”moving security from the end of the development process to the very beginning. The goal is ...to make [security](/security-best-practices) a shared responsibility and to build secure software from the start..., rather than trying to patch it later.

## Key Takeaways

- **Shift Security Left**: The core principle of DevSecOps is to move security practices as early as possible in the development lifecycle. This means developers get immediate feedback on security issues, making them easier and cheaper to fix.
- **Automation is Essential**: DevSecOps relies on automating security testing. This includes Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to scan source code, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to check for vulnerable dependencies, and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) to test the running application.
- **Security as Code**: Just like Infrastructure as Code, Security as Code treats security policies, compliance checks, and tests as code. They are stored in version control, automated, and integrated into the pipeline.

## The Solution

In traditional development models, security testing often happens at the very end of the cycle, performed by a separate security team. This creates a bottleneck, slows down releases, and makes fixing vulnerabilities expensive. DevSecOps breaks down these silos by embedding security into the automated CI/CD pipeline. By providing developers with automated tools that give them instant feedback on security vulnerabilities as they write code, security becomes a natural part of the development workflow, not an obstacle to it. This allows teams to move fast _and_ stay secure.

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Integrate a Secret Scanner**
    As a first step, add a tool like [Git-secrets](/devops/mastering-gitops-a-guide-to-managing-infrastructure-with-git) or TruffleHog to your CI pipeline. This tool should run on every commit to scan your codebase for accidentally committed secrets like API keys or passwords, and fail the build if any are found.

2.  **Add Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**
    Use a tool like OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, or GitHub's Dependabot to automatically scan your project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities (CVEs). This should be a required step in your CI pipeline.

3.  **Implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**
    Integrate a SAST tool (like SonarQube or Snyk Code) into the pipeline. SAST tools analyze your source code for common security flaws, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, without actually running the code.

4.  **Add Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**
    In a later stage of your pipeline (e.g., after deploying to a staging environment), run a DAST scan. DAST tools test your _running_ application from the outside-in, actively probing it for vulnerabilities in the same way an attacker would.

## Common Questions

**Q: Won't adding all these security scans slow down my CI/CD pipeline?**
Yes, they can add time. The key is to be strategic. Run fast, lightweight scans (like secret scanning and SCA) on every commit. Reserve more time-consuming scans (like DAST) for deployments to staging or nightly builds. The goal is to provide the most valuable feedback as quickly as possible.

**Q: Who is responsible for fixing the vulnerabilities that are found?**
In a DevSecOps culture, the developer who introduced the vulnerability is typically responsible for fixing it. The automated tools provide them with the context and guidance they need to do so. The security team's role shifts from being gatekeepers to being expert consultants who help teams understand and mitigate complex risks.

**Q: What is the difference between SAST and DAST?**
SAST is a "white-box" testing method; it looks at the application's source code from the inside. DAST is a "black-box" method; it tests the running application from the outside without any knowledge of the internal code. They find different types of vulnerabilities and are most effective when used together.

## Tools & Resources

- **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)**: A popular, open-source DAST tool that can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline to automatically find vulnerabilities in your web applications.
- **Snyk**: A developer-focused security platform that provides SAST, SCA, and container scanning tools that are easy to integrate into CI/CD pipelines.
- **SonarQube**: A widely-used open-source platform for continuous inspection of code quality and security. It provides static analysis for many programming languages.
