# An Introduction to Microservices Architecture

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Microservices are an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, autonomous, and loosely coupled services, each organized around a specific business capability. Unlike a [**monolithic architecture**](/microservices/decomposing-a-monolith-into-microservices)..., where the entire application is built as a single, unified unit, a microservices architecture is composed of multiple, independently deployable services. For example, in an e-commerce application, you might have separate services for user management, product catalog, and order processing.

## Key Takeaways

- **Independently Deployable**: Each microservice can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. A change to the order service doesn't require you to redeploy the entire application.
- **Organized Around Business Capabilities**: Each service is responsible for a specific business function. This aligns the architecture with the business domain and promotes ownership by small, focused teams.
- **Increased Complexity**: The primary drawback of microservices is the inherent complexity of a distributed system. You have to deal with challenges like network latency, [service discovery](/microservices/a-guide-to-service-discovery), and data consistency between services.

## The Solution: Monolith vs. Microservices

### The Monolith

A monolithic application is built as a single, cohesive unit. All the code for the UI, business logic, and data access is in one codebase, and it is deployed as a single artifact.

- **Pros**: Simple to develop, test, and deploy initially.
- **Cons**: Becomes difficult to maintain and scale as it grows. A bug in any part of the application can bring down the entire system. Adopting new technologies is difficult.

### Microservices

Microservices break down a large application into a suite of small, independent services.

- **Pros**:
  - **Improved Scalability**: You can scale individual services based on their specific needs (e.g., give more resources to the high-traffic product catalog service).
  - **Faster Development Cycles**: Small, independent teams can work on different services in parallel and deploy them without coordinating with other teams.
  - **Technology Freedom**: Each service can be written in the programming language and use the database that is best suited for its specific task.
- **Cons**:
  - **Operational Complexity**: You need a mature [DevOps practice](/devops)...
  - **Distributed System Challenges**: You must handle issues like network failures, data consistency, and inter-service communication, which don't exist in a monolith.

## When to Choose Microservices

For small projects and startups, starting with a **well-structured monolith** is often the most pragmatic approach. It allows you to move fast and iterate quickly without the overhead of a distributed system. As the application and the team grow in complexity, you can then begin to strategically break off pieces of the monolith into microservices. This is often called the "[Strangler Fig Pattern](/microservices/decomposing-a-monolith-into-microservices)." Adopting microservices from day one for a new, unproven product can be a form of premature optimization that slows you down unnecessarily.

## Common Questions

**Q: How small should a microservice be?**
There is no fixed rule. A common guideline is that a service should be small enough to be managed by a single, small team (a "two-pizza team"). It should be focused on a single business capability. The goal is not to make services as small as possible, but to find the right service boundaries.

**Q: How do microservices communicate with each other?**
Services can communicate synchronously using APIs (like REST or gRPC) or ...asynchronously using a [message queue](/system-design/introduction-to-message-queues-for-asynchronous-communication) (like RabbitMQ or Kafka). The choice depends on the specific requirements of the interaction.

**Q: Don't microservices just create a distributed monolith?**
This is a common failure pattern. A "distributed monolith" occurs when your services are technically separate but are so tightly coupled that they must all be deployed together. This can happen if you don't define your service boundaries correctly. Proper microservice design requires loose coupling and high cohesion.

## Tools & Resources

- **Building Microservices** by Sam Newman: The seminal book on microservices architecture.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: A software design approach that is crucial for identifying good microservice boundaries.
- **The 12-Factor App**: A methodology for building modern, scalable, and maintainable software-as-a-service applications that aligns well with microservice principles.
