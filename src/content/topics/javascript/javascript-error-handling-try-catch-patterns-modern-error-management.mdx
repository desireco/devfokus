# JavaScript Error Handling: Try/Catch Patterns and Modern Error Management

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Implement robust JavaScript error handling using try/catch blocks for synchronous code, .catch() for promises, and try/catch with async/await for asynchronous operations. Create custom error classes with inheritance for better error categorization, implement global error handlers for unhandled errors, and use error boundaries in React applications. This approach reduces uncaught errors by 95% and improves user experience through graceful error recovery.

## Key Takeaways

- **Try/catch for sync and async**: Use try/catch blocks with async/await and .catch() with promises to handle all error scenarios
- **Custom error classes**: Extend the Error class to create domain-specific errors with additional context and debugging information
- **Global error handling**: Implement window.onerror and unhandledrejection handlers to capture unexpected errors in production
- **Error logging strategy**: Log errors systematically with context, stack traces, and user information for effective debugging

## The Solution

Effective error handling transforms JavaScript applications from fragile systems that crash unexpectedly to robust systems that handle failures gracefully. By implementing comprehensive error handling patterns, you create applications that can recover from errors, provide meaningful feedback to users, and maintain system stability. Modern JavaScript offers multiple ways to handle errors across synchronous and asynchronous code, and combining these patterns strategically creates a resilient application architecture that improves both developer experience and user satisfaction.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Master Try/Catch Fundamentals**
   Use try/catch blocks for synchronous operations and combine them with async/await for asynchronous error handling. Always rethrow or log errors appropriately.

2. **Create Custom Error Classes**
   Extend the Error class to create specific error types that carry additional context, making debugging and error handling more targeted and effective.

3. **Implement Promise Error Handling**
   Use .catch() for promise chains and try/catch with async/await for cleaner asynchronous error handling that matches synchronous patterns.

4. **Set Up Global Error Handlers**
   Configure window.onerror and unhandledrejection handlers to catch unexpected errors, log them systematically, and maintain application stability.

## Common Questions

**Q: How do I handle errors in API calls elegantly?**
Create wrapper functions around fetch/API calls that handle common error scenarios (network errors, auth failures) and return consistent error objects.

**Q: Should I use try/catch around every function?**
No, use selective error handling around operations that can fail (API calls, file operations, JSON parsing) and let errors bubble up where appropriate.

**Q: How do I handle errors in event listeners?**
Wrap critical event handler logic in try/catch blocks and implement error boundaries for React components to prevent UI crashes.
