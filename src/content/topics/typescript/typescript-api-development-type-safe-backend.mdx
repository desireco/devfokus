# TypeScript API Development: Type-Safe Backend Development

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Build type-safe backend APIs by leveraging TypeScript interfaces for request/response types, implementing typed middleware with generic constraints, using Express's built-in type definitions, and integrating OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation. This approach reduces API-related bugs by 90% and provides automatic contract validation between frontend and backend.

## Key Takeaways

- **Typed endpoints**: Use interfaces to define request and response types for each API endpoint, ensuring contract safety
- **Generic middleware**: Implement middleware with generic types that maintain type safety across the request pipeline
- **Error handling**: Create typed error responses with proper HTTP status codes and consistent error structures
- **OpenAPI integration**: Use tools like `swagger-typescript-api` to generate types from OpenAPI specifications

## The Solution

TypeScript transforms backend API development from loosely-typed route handlers to strongly-typed contracts that prevent data mismatches and runtime errors. By properly typing Express.js requests, responses, middleware, and error handlers, you create self-documenting APIs that enforce data contracts at compile time. This type safety extends to database models, validation schemas, and API responses, ensuring that your API behaves predictably and that frontend-backend integration is seamless. The result is a robust backend where type errors are caught during development rather than production.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Define Request and Response Types**
   Create interfaces for request bodies, query parameters, and response payloads for each API endpoint to establish clear contracts.

2. **Implement Typed Middleware**
   Use Express's generic types (`Request`, `Response`, `NextFunction`) and create custom middleware that maintains type information throughout the request pipeline.

3. **Set Up Typed Error Handling**
   Create typed error classes and error middleware that properly type error responses while maintaining consistency across the API.

4. **Integrate OpenAPI Type Generation**
   Use tools to generate TypeScript types from OpenAPI specifications, ensuring frontend and backend types stay synchronized automatically.

## Common Questions

**Q: How do I handle dynamic route parameters with TypeScript?**
Use Express's parameter extraction with typed route handlers and validate parameters using middleware that narrows types dynamically.

**Q: Should I type database models or API responses separately?**
Create separate types for database models and API responses, using mapper functions to transform between them while maintaining type safety.

**Q: How do I handle file uploads in typed APIs?**
Use libraries like `multer` with proper type definitions and extend the Express Request type to include file properties for upload endpoints.
