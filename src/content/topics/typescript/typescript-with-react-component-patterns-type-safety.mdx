# TypeScript with React: Component Patterns and Type Safety

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Build type-safe React applications by properly typing props with interfaces, using generic components for reusability, leveraging React's built-in types for events and forms, and implementing discriminated unions for component variants. This approach eliminates 95% of runtime prop errors and provides excellent IntelliSense for better developer experience.

## Key Takeaways

- **Props interfaces**: Use interfaces for component props with optional properties and default values for flexible, type-safe components
- **Generic components**: Implement generic components with `<T extends object>` to create reusable type-safe components
- **Event typing**: Leverage React's `ChangeEvent`, `FormEvent`, and `MouseEvent` types for proper event handling
- **Discriminated unions**: Use type guards and discriminated unions for components with multiple variants or states

## The Solution

TypeScript transforms React development from loosely-typed JavaScript to a strongly-typed experience that catches errors at compile time. By properly typing React components, props, events, and hooks, you create self-documenting APIs that prevent common runtime errors. The combination of TypeScript's type system and React's component architecture enables you to build complex UIs with confidence, knowing that props are correct, state is properly typed, and event handlers work as expected. This type safety extends to forms, routing, and all aspects of React development.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Define Component Props with Interfaces**
   Create explicit interfaces for component props, making optional properties clear and providing proper TypeScript documentation for each component.

2. **Implement Generic Components**
   Use generics with constraints (`<T extends object>`) to create reusable components that maintain type safety across different data structures.

3. **Type Events and Event Handlers**
   Use React's event types like `React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>` and `React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>` for properly typed event handlers.

4. **Use Discriminated Unions for Component Variants**
   Implement discriminated unions using a common `type` property to handle different component states and variants with full type safety.

## Common Questions

**Q: Should I use interfaces or types for React props?**
Use interfaces for component props that might be extended or for better error messages. Use types for unions, intersections, and more complex type manipulation.

**Q: How do I type useCallback and useEffect properly?**
Type dependencies arrays explicitly and provide proper typing for callback functions. TypeScript can infer most useEffect dependencies from the dependency array.

**Q: What's the best way to handle children props?**
Use `React.ReactNode` for the `children` prop to allow all valid React child types including strings, numbers, elements, and arrays.
