# Real-time Edge Computer Vision: Implementation best practices

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Real-time edge computer vision requires model architecture redesign with depthwise separable convolutions, neural architecture search (NAS) for optimal performance, and hardware-specific optimizations to achieve 30+ FPS on mobile devices while maintaining 90%+ accuracy.

## Key Takeaways

- **MobileNetV3 architecture delivers best efficiency**: Depthwise separable convolutions reduce computation by 8-9x while maintaining accuracy, enabling real-time performance on edge devices
- **Hardware-specific backends improve performance**: Use GPU delegation for Android (OpenGL ES), Metal Performance Shaders for iOS, and TensorRT for NVIDIA Jetson to achieve 3-4x speedup
- **Dynamic model switching optimizes resource usage**: Implement multi-model cascades that switch between complex and simple models based on scene complexity, saving 40-60% compute resources

## The Solution

Optimizing computer vision for real-time edge deployment requires a holistic approach combining lightweight model architectures, hardware acceleration, and intelligent resource management. Start by selecting or designing models with depthwise separable convolutions and attention mechanisms that maximize accuracy per FLOP. Then implement hardware-specific optimizations using platform delegates and ensure proper input pipeline optimization with tiling and batch processing. The key is achieving the optimal balance between accuracy, latency, and power consumption for your specific edge deployment scenario.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Select efficient model architecture**
   Use MobileNetV3, EfficientNet-Lite, or NAS models designed specifically for edge deployment, focusing on models optimized for your target hardware platform.

2. **Implement hardware acceleration delegates**
   Configure TensorFlow Lite with GPU delegate for Android, Core ML delegate for iOS, and TensorRT for edge servers to leverage specialized hardware acceleration.

3. **Optimize input processing pipeline**
   Implement efficient image preprocessing with hardware-accelerated libraries, using techniques like tiling for large images and asynchronous preprocessing to minimize bottlenecks.

4. **Deploy with adaptive model selection**
   Create model cascades that dynamically choose between high-accuracy and lightweight models based on available resources and processing requirements.

## Common Questions

**Q: How do I achieve 30+ FPS on mobile devices?**
Combine lightweight architectures like MobileNetV3 with GPU delegation, reduce input resolution to 224x224, and implement frame skipping for non-critical frames to maintain consistent throughput.

**Q: Should I use quantization for computer vision models?**
Apply INT8 quantization carefully for vision models, using per-channel quantization for convolutional layers to maintain accuracy while achieving 2-3x speedup.

**Q: How do I handle different lighting conditions on edge devices?**
Implement dynamic range normalization and adaptive histogram equalization in the preprocessing pipeline, plus consider training models with domain randomization for robustness.
