# Building secure APIs from scratch

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Building secure APIs requires implementing multiple security layers: strong authentication (JWT/OAuth), role-based authorization, comprehensive input validation, rate limiting, and HTTPS encryption. Follow OWASP API Security Top 10 guidelines, validate all inputs, sanitize outputs, and implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information. Use security headers, audit logging, and regular security testing to maintain robust protection.

## Key Takeaways

- **Defense in depth**: Implement 6+ security layers including authentication, authorization, input validation, rate limiting, encryption, and monitoring
- **Zero-trust validation**: Validate every input, sanitize all outputs, and never trust client-side data - reduces security incidents by 85%
- **Proper error handling**: Return generic error messages to clients while logging detailed information server-side to prevent information disclosure

## The Solution

Secure API development starts with a security-first mindset during the design phase. Rather than adding security as an afterthought, build it into every layer of your API architecture from authentication and data validation to error handling and monitoring.

The foundation of API security rests on three core principles: authentication (who you are), authorization (what you can do), and validation (ensuring data integrity). Implement these consistently across all endpoints, use established security standards like OAuth 2.0 and JWT, and follow the principle of least privilege for all access controls.

Modern secure APIs also require protection against automated attacks through rate limiting, comprehensive logging for security monitoring, and proper error handling that provides useful feedback without exposing sensitive system information. This multi-layered approach creates robust protection against both common vulnerabilities and sophisticated attack vectors.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Design secure authentication system**
   Implement JWT-based authentication with secure token generation, proper expiration times, and refresh token rotation. Use bcrypt for password hashing with minimum 12 rounds and enforce strong password policies.

2. **Build role-based authorization framework**
   Create granular permission system with roles, scopes, and resource-level access controls. Implement middleware that checks permissions before processing any request and follows principle of least privilege.

3. **Implement comprehensive input validation**
   Validate all inputs using schema validation libraries, sanitize data to prevent injection attacks, and implement proper type checking. Reject invalid requests early in the request pipeline.

4. **Add security middleware and headers**
   Configure CORS policies, implement security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options), add request logging, and set up rate limiting to prevent abuse and automated attacks.

5. **Establish monitoring and incident response**
   Implement security event logging, set up alerts for suspicious activities, create incident response procedures, and conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.

## Common Questions

**Q: Should I use JWT or session-based authentication for my API?**
JWT tokens are better for stateless, distributed APIs as they don't require server-side session storage and work well with microservices. Use session-based auth for traditional web applications where you need immediate token revocation. For high-security applications, consider short-lived JWTs with refresh tokens.

**Q: How do I handle API versioning while maintaining security?**
Implement security consistently across all API versions, deprecate old versions with known vulnerabilities, and use semantic versioning. Maintain security patches for supported versions and provide clear migration paths. Never compromise security for backward compatibility.

**Q: What's the best way to handle sensitive data in API responses?**
Never include sensitive data in responses unless absolutely necessary. Use field filtering to return only required data, implement data masking for sensitive fields, and consider separate endpoints for sensitive operations. Always encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
