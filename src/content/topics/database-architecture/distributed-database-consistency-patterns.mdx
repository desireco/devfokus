# Distributed Database Consistency Patterns

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Choose strong consistency for financial and critical data requiring immediate consistency across all nodes, eventual consistency for high-availability scenarios with tolerance for temporary inconsistencies, and hybrid approaches like causal consistency for balanced solutions. The choice depends on your specific requirements for data accuracy, availability, and performance.

## Key Takeaways

- **CAP theorem trade-offs**: You can only choose two of Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance - understand which two matter most for your use case
- **Strong consistency costs**: Immediate consistency across distributed nodes requires coordination overhead that impacts latency and availability during network partitions
- **Eventual consistency benefits**: Provides higher availability and better performance but requires application-level handling of temporary data inconsistencies
- **Hybrid solutions exist**: Patterns like causal consistency, read-your-writes, and session consistency offer middle grounds between strong and eventual consistency

## The Solution

Distributed database consistency patterns determine how data remains synchronized across multiple nodes in your system. The fundamental challenge lies in the CAP theorem: during network partitions, you must choose between consistency and availability. Strong consistency ensures all nodes see the same data simultaneously but sacrifices availability during partitions. Eventual consistency prioritizes availability, allowing temporary inconsistencies that resolve over time. Understanding these patterns enables you to design systems that meet your specific requirements for data accuracy, user experience, and system reliability. The right consistency pattern depends on your business requirements, user expectations, and operational constraints.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Analyze Consistency Requirements**
   Identify which data requires strong consistency (financial transactions, inventory) versus eventual consistency (social feeds, analytics) based on business impact.

2. **Choose Consistency Model**
   Select strong consistency for critical operations, eventual consistency for high-throughput scenarios, or hybrid models for balanced requirements.

3. **Implement Coordination Mechanisms**
   Use consensus algorithms like Paxos or Raft for strong consistency, or vector clocks and conflict resolution for eventual consistency.

4. **Design Conflict Resolution**
   Implement strategies like last-write-wins, merge functions, or application-specific resolution for handling conflicting updates in eventually consistent systems.

5. **Handle Network Partitions**
   Design graceful degradation strategies that maintain system availability during network splits while ensuring data integrity when connectivity restores.

6. **Monitor Consistency State**
   Implement metrics to track consistency lag, convergence time, and system health to ensure your consistency patterns meet operational requirements.

7. **Test Failure Scenarios**
   Regularly test network partitions, node failures, and split-brain scenarios to validate your consistency mechanisms and recovery procedures.

## Common Questions

**Q: When should I use strong vs eventual consistency?**
Use strong consistency for financial data, user authentication, and inventory management. Use eventual consistency for social media feeds, recommendation engines, and analytics where slight delays are acceptable.

**Q: How do I handle conflicts in eventually consistent systems?**
Implement conflict resolution strategies like operational transformation (CRDTs), application-specific merge functions, or timestamp-based resolution with user intervention for complex cases.

**Q: What's the performance impact of strong consistency?**
Strong consistency typically adds 2-3x latency due to coordination overhead and can reduce availability during network partitions by 30-50% compared to eventually consistent systems.
