# Database Indexing Best Practices

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Effective database indexing requires strategic placement of indexes on frequently queried columns, using composite indexes for multi-column queries, and regularly monitoring index usage. Balance read performance gains against write overhead, and remove unused indexes to maintain optimal database performance.

## Key Takeaways

- **Query analysis first**: Index based on actual query patterns, not assumptions - use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to identify slow queries and missing indexes
- **Composite index order**: Place most selective columns first in multi-column indexes, and match the column order to your WHERE clause conditions
- **Covering indexes**: Include all needed columns in your index to eliminate table lookups and dramatically improve query performance
- **Regular maintenance**: Monitor index usage statistics and remove unused indexes that consume storage and slow down writes

## The Solution

Database indexing transforms query performance by creating data structures that enable rapid data retrieval without full table scans. The key is understanding your query patterns, selecting appropriate index types, and maintaining the right balance between read performance and write overhead. Proper indexing can reduce query execution time by 90% or more, while over-indexing can degrade write performance and increase storage costs. Strategic indexing involves analyzing your workload, choosing optimal index types (B-tree, hash, GIN, etc.), and continuously monitoring and adjusting your index strategy as your application evolves.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Analyze Query Patterns**
   Use database monitoring tools and EXPLAIN ANALYZE to identify slow queries, frequent access patterns, and missing index opportunities.

2. **Choose Index Types Wisely**
   Select B-tree indexes for equality and range queries, hash indexes for exact matches, and specialized indexes (GIN, GiST) for full-text search and JSON data.

3. **Design Composite Indexes**
   Create multi-column indexes that match your WHERE clause order, placing the most selective columns first for maximum effectiveness.

4. **Implement Covering Indexes**
   Include frequently accessed columns in your index using INCLUDE clauses (PostgreSQL) or covered indexes (MySQL) to eliminate table lookups.

5. **Monitor Index Usage**
   Regularly check index statistics to identify unused indexes and high-impact indexes that provide the most performance benefits.

6. **Optimize Write Performance**
   Balance read performance gains against write overhead by avoiding excessive indexing and considering index maintenance during bulk operations.

## Common Questions

**Q: How many indexes are too many?**
There's no magic number, but if you have more indexes than tables or if write performance is suffering, you likely have too many. Focus on high-impact indexes that serve multiple queries.

**Q: Should I index foreign keys?**
Yes, foreign key columns should almost always be indexed to improve JOIN performance and prevent locking issues during cascading operations.

**Q: When should I use partial indexes?**
Use partial indexes for queries that only access a subset of data, such as WHERE status = 'active', to reduce index size and improve performance.
