# Database Backup & Disaster Recovery

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Implement the 3-2-1 backup rule (3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite), automate daily full backups with hourly transaction logs, define clear RTO/RPO targets, and test recovery procedures monthly. Use point-in-time recovery for critical databases and geographic distribution for disaster resilience.

## Key Takeaways

- **3-2-1 backup rule**: Maintain three copies of data on two different media types with one copy stored offsite for comprehensive protection
- **RTO/RPO clarity**: Define Recovery Time Objective (how quickly you need to recover) and Recovery Point Objective (how much data you can afford to lose)
- **Automated verification**: Regularly test backup integrity and recovery procedures to ensure backups are reliable and recovery processes work
- **Geographic distribution**: Use cross-region or multi-cloud backup storage to protect against regional disasters and ensure business continuity

## The Solution

Database backup and disaster recovery are critical for business continuity, protecting against data loss from hardware failures, human errors, cyber attacks, and natural disasters. A comprehensive strategy combines regular automated backups, point-in-time recovery capabilities, geographic distribution, and thoroughly tested recovery procedures. The key is understanding your business requirements (RTO/RPO), implementing appropriate backup frequencies and retention policies, and ensuring you can actually restore your data when needed. Modern disaster recovery leverages cloud storage, automated failover, and continuous data protection to minimize downtime and data loss while managing costs effectively.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Define RTO and RPO Requirements**
   Assess business impact to determine acceptable downtime (RTO) and data loss (RPO) for different database systems and applications.

2. **Design Backup Strategy**
   Implement full daily backups with hourly transaction log backups, using the 3-2-1 rule for redundancy and geographic distribution.

3. **Choose Backup Technology**
   Select native database backup tools, cloud-native solutions, or third-party backup software based on your database platform and requirements.

4. **Implement Point-in-Time Recovery**
   Configure continuous transaction log backup and testing procedures to enable recovery to any specific point in time.

5. **Set Up Geographic Distribution**
   Store backup copies in different geographic regions or cloud providers to protect against regional disasters.

6. **Automate Backup Verification**
   Implement automated backup integrity checks, regular restore testing, and monitoring for backup failures or corruption.

7. **Create Disaster Recovery Plan**
   Document step-by-step recovery procedures, define roles and responsibilities, and establish communication protocols for disaster scenarios.

## Common Questions

**Q: How often should I test my disaster recovery procedures?**
Test full disaster recovery procedures quarterly, with monthly backup verification and annual comprehensive drills involving all stakeholders.

**Q: What's the difference between hot, warm, and cold disaster recovery sites?**
Hot sites are fully operational with real-time data sync (minutes RTO), warm sites have infrastructure but need data restoration (hours RTO), cold sites require full setup (days RTO).

**Q: How do I handle backup encryption and security?**
Encrypt backups both in transit and at rest, manage encryption keys separately from backups, and implement strict access controls for backup systems and data.
