# Mobile Database Selection Guide

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Choose SQLite for simplicity and broad compatibility, Realm for performance and object-oriented design, Core Data for iOS-native apps, Firebase Realtime Database for real-time synchronization, or WatermelonDB/Realm for React Native. The decision depends on your platform, data complexity, offline requirements, and synchronization needs.

## Key Takeaways

- **Platform considerations**: Native apps benefit from platform-specific databases (Core Data for iOS, Room for Android), while cross-platform needs unified solutions
- **Offline capabilities matter**: Choose databases with robust offline support and conflict resolution if your app needs to work without internet connectivity
- **Performance vs. complexity**: SQLite offers simplicity but requires more boilerplate, while ORM solutions provide easier development at the cost of some performance
- **Real-time synchronization**: Firebase and Supabase excel at real-time data sync but require internet connectivity and have ongoing costs

## The Solution

Mobile database selection significantly impacts your app's performance, user experience, and development complexity. Unlike server databases, mobile databases must handle limited resources, intermittent connectivity, and platform-specific constraints. The right choice balances data modeling needs, offline capabilities, synchronization requirements, and development productivity. Native databases like Core Data and Room offer deep platform integration but lock you to specific platforms. Cross-platform solutions like SQLite and Realm provide consistency across iOS and Android but may sacrifice some platform-specific optimizations. Understanding these trade-offs enables you to select a database that supports your app's requirements while maintaining optimal performance and user experience.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Assess Data Requirements**
   Evaluate data complexity, relationships, query patterns, and storage needs to determine if you need a simple key-value store or a full relational database.

2. **Define Offline Strategy**
   Determine if your app needs full offline functionality, partial offline support, or can require constant internet connectivity.

3. **Consider Platform Strategy**
   Decide between native development (platform-specific databases) or cross-platform development (unified database solutions).

4. **Evaluate Synchronization Needs**
   Assess whether you need real-time synchronization, periodic sync, or manual sync capabilities with conflict resolution.

5. **Performance Testing**
   Benchmark database options with realistic data volumes and query patterns to measure performance on target devices.

6. **Development Complexity Analysis**
   Consider your team's expertise and the learning curve for different database options and their associated ORMs.

7. **Long-term Maintenance Planning**
   Evaluate migration paths, backup strategies, and long-term support for your chosen database solution.

## Common Questions

**Q: Should I use SQLite or an ORM like Realm?**
SQLite offers maximum control and performance but requires more boilerplate code. Realm provides easier development with object-oriented design but has a larger binary size and less flexibility.

**Q: What's the best database for React Native apps?**
WatermelonDB, Realm, and AsyncStorage are popular choices. WatermelonDB excels with offline-first apps, while Firebase works well for real-time synchronization needs.

**Q: How do I handle database migrations in mobile apps?**
Use built-in migration tools like Room's Migration system, Realm's migration API, or implement custom versioning logic with SQLite to handle schema changes gracefully.

## Tools & Resources

- **SQLite** - Lightweight, serverless SQL database with broad platform support and minimal dependencies
- **Realm Database** - Object-oriented database with real-time synchronization and cross-platform support
- **Core Data** - Apple's persistence framework with deep iOS integration and automatic migration support
- **Android Room** - Google's recommended persistence library providing an abstraction layer over SQLite
- **Firebase Realtime Database** - Cloud-hosted NoSQL database with real-time synchronization capabilities
- **WatermelonDB** - Reactive database framework optimized for React Native with offline-first design
