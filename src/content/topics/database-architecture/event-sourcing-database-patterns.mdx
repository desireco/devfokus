# Event Sourcing Database Patterns

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Event sourcing stores all state changes as immutable events, enabling complete audit trails, temporal queries, and system resilience. Combine with CQRS for optimal read/write performance, use event stores like EventStoreDB or Kafka, and implement proper event versioning and snapshotting for performance.

## Key Takeaways

- **Immutable event log**: Store all state changes as sequential events rather than current state, providing complete audit trails and temporal capabilities
- **CQRS separation**: Separate command (write) and query (read) models to optimize each side independently for different performance requirements
- **Event versioning**: Implement schema evolution strategies for events to handle changing business requirements without breaking existing data
- **Snapshot optimization**: Use periodic snapshots to avoid replaying entire event streams when reconstructing current state

## The Solution

Event sourcing fundamentally changes how we think about data persistence by storing the sequence of events that led to the current state rather than just the state itself. This approach provides complete audit trails, enables temporal queries (what was the state at any point in time), and supports system resilience through event replay. When combined with Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), it allows independent optimization of write and read operations. The architecture requires careful consideration of event design, versioning, storage, and reconstruction strategies. While more complex than traditional CRUD patterns, event sourcing provides unparalleled capabilities for audit, debugging, and system recovery that are essential for mission-critical applications.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Design Event Schema**
   Create immutable event structures with unique IDs, timestamps, event types, and version information to support schema evolution.

2. **Choose Event Store Technology**
   Select EventStoreDB for dedicated event sourcing, Kafka for streaming platforms, or implement custom event stores on top of existing databases.

3. **Implement CQRS Pattern**
   Separate command handlers for processing events and query models optimized for read performance with materialized views.

4. **Create Event Handlers**
   Build event processors that update read models, generate notifications, and maintain consistency across different system components.

5. **Implement Snapshot Strategy**
   Create periodic snapshots of aggregate state to optimize performance when reconstructing current state from event streams.

6. **Design Event Versioning**
   Implement upcasting strategies to handle event schema evolution while maintaining backward compatibility with existing events.

7. **Set Up Monitoring and Recovery**
   Implement event replay capabilities, monitoring for event processing lag, and recovery procedures for system failures.

## Common Questions

**Q: How do I handle event schema changes over time?**
Use event versioning with upcasters that transform old event formats to new ones, maintaining backward compatibility while supporting evolving business requirements.

**Q: What's the performance impact of replaying events?**
Event replay can be expensive. Mitigate this with snapshots, efficient event storage, and optimized replay strategies that only process relevant events.

**Q: How do I handle duplicate events and idempotency?**
Implement idempotent event handlers, use unique event IDs, and design your system to handle duplicate events gracefully without causing inconsistent state.
