# Security Testing Automation: Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Security testing automation integrates vulnerability scanning, dependency analysis, and penetration testing into CI/CD pipelines, catching 85% of security vulnerabilities before production and reducing security testing effort by 70%.

## Key Takeaways

- **Static analysis finds code vulnerabilities early**: Scan source code for security issues, malicious code patterns, and configuration problems during development before deployment
- **Dynamic testing validates runtime security**: Test running applications for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, authentication flaws, and input validation issues
- **Dependency scanning prevents vulnerable libraries**: Automatically scan third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities and license compliance issues in development pipelines

## The Solution

Security testing automation transforms manual security assessments into continuous, integrated processes that catch vulnerabilities early and consistently. The solution combines static code analysis, dynamic application security testing, and dependency scanning with automated penetration testing. By implementing comprehensive security testing automation, teams can prevent common vulnerabilities, maintain compliance with security standards, and reduce the risk of security incidents while minimizing manual testing overhead.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Design security testing pipeline**
   Map security testing stages to CI/CD pipeline, define security gates and failure criteria, and establish alerting and escalation procedures for security issues.

2. **Implement static security analysis**
   Deploy SAST tools with custom security rules, code pattern analysis, and configuration security scanning to catch vulnerabilities during development.

3. **Deploy dynamic security testing**
   Implement DAST tools, OWASP testing, and automated penetration testing to validate runtime security and identify vulnerability exploitation risks.

4. **Establish dependency and infrastructure security**
   Configure software composition analysis, infrastructure security scanning, and container security validation to ensure comprehensive protection.

## Common Questions

**Q: How do you balance security testing with development velocity?**
Implement security testing in parallel with development, use optimized scanning strategies, and focus on critical vulnerabilities to maintain velocity while ensuring security.

**Q: What's the difference between SAST and DAST?**
Static Application Security Testing (SAST) analyzes source code, while Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tests running applications - both are needed for comprehensive security coverage.

**Q: How do you handle security test false positives?**
Implement confidence scoring, custom rule tuning, and manual review processes to reduce false positives while maintaining security vigilance and effectiveness.

## Tools & Resources

- **Static Analysis Tools** - SonarQube, Snyk Code, Checkmarx, or Semgrep for source code vulnerability analysis and security issue detection
- **Dynamic Testing Tools** - OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or DAST-specific tools for runtime security testing and penetration testing automation
- **Dependency Scanning** - Snyk, Dependabot, OWASP Dependency-Check, or Trivy for third-party vulnerability scanning and license compliance
- **Infrastructure Security** - Terraform Security Scanner, Falco, or cloud-native security tools for infrastructure and container security validation
