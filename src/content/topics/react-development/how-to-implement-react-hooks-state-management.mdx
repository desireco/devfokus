# How to implement React hooks for state management?

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

React hooks revolutionized state management by providing a simpler, more intuitive way to handle component state without class components. Use `useState` for simple state, `useReducer` for complex state logic, and create custom hooks for reusable stateful logic. The key is understanding when to use each hook and how to avoid common performance pitfalls.

## Key Takeaways

- **Start with useState**: Use `useState` for primitive values and simple state objects - it handles 80% of state management needs
- **Level up with useReducer**: When state logic becomes complex or involves multiple sub-values, `useReducer` provides better predictability and testability
- **Create custom hooks**: Extract reusable stateful logic into custom hooks to share behavior across components without prop drilling
- **Avoid performance traps**: Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders when passing state to child components

## The Solution

React hooks provide a more direct API to React concepts you already know: props, state, context, refs, and lifecycle. For state management specifically, hooks eliminate the need for class components and provide a cleaner way to handle state changes. The primary hooks for state management are `useState` for simple state and `useReducer` for complex state logic. Custom hooks allow you to extract component logic into reusable functions, making your code more maintainable and testable.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Start with useState for basic state**
   Use `useState` when you have independent state variables or simple objects. It returns the current state value and a function to update it.

2. **Implement useReducer for complex state**
   Switch to `useReducer` when state updates depend on previous values, when you have multiple sub-values, or when state logic becomes complex.

3. **Create custom hooks for reusable logic**
   Extract stateful logic into custom hooks when multiple components need the same state behavior.

4. **Optimize performance with memoization**
   Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders when passing state or functions to child components.

## Common Questions

**Q: When should I use useState vs useReducer?**
Use `useState` for simple, independent state values. Switch to `useReducer` when state updates become complex, involve multiple related values, or when you need predictable state transitions with actions.

**Q: How do I avoid infinite re-renders with hooks?**
Ensure your dependency arrays in `useEffect`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo` include all necessary dependencies. Use stable references and avoid creating new objects/arrays in render.

**Q: Can I use hooks for global state management?**
While possible, hooks are best for local component state. For global state, consider Context API with hooks, or dedicated state management libraries like Zustand or Redux Toolkit.
