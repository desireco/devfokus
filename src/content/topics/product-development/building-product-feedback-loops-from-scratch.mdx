# Building product feedback loops from scratch

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Build product feedback loops by implementing multiple collection channels (in-app surveys, interviews, support tickets), creating a centralized feedback database, developing a scoring and prioritization system, establishing regular review processes, and closing the loop with customers about implemented changes.

## Key Takeaways

- **Multiple collection channels**: Use in-app surveys, customer interviews, support tickets, and social media to gather diverse feedback
- **Centralized database**: Create a single source of truth for all feedback to identify patterns and prevent insights from getting lost
- **Close the loop**: Always inform customers when their feedback leads to product improvements to encourage future participation

## The Solution

Effective product feedback loops systematically capture, analyze, and act on customer insights to drive continuous product improvement. The solution involves creating a multi-channel collection system, establishing processes for feedback analysis and prioritization, and building mechanisms to close the loop with customers while ensuring insights translate into actionable product decisions.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Set up multi-channel feedback collection**
   Implement in-app NPS surveys, feedback forms, customer interview programs, and integrate support ticket data to capture insights from multiple touchpoints.

2. **Create a centralized feedback database**
   Use tools like Canny, Productboard, or a custom Airtable setup to consolidate all feedback in one place with tags, customer segments, and feature requests.

3. **Develop feedback scoring and prioritization**
   Create a framework that scores feedback based on customer value, business impact, implementation effort, and strategic alignment to prioritize what to build next.

4. **Establish review and implementation processes**
   Set up weekly feedback review meetings, monthly roadmap planning sessions, and quarterly retrospectives to ensure insights drive product decisions.

## Common Questions

**Q: How much feedback should I collect before taking action?**
Look for patterns across 5-10 customers mentioning similar issues. Quality of insights matters more than quantity - one detailed customer story can be more valuable than 100 vague comments.

**Q: Should I pay for feedback collection tools?**
Start with free tools like Google Forms and Airtable, then invest in dedicated platforms like Canny or Productboard as your feedback volume and complexity grow.

**Q: How do I handle conflicting feedback?**
Segment feedback by customer type, usage patterns, and value. Prioritize feedback from your ideal customer profile and high-value users over edge cases or non-target segments.
