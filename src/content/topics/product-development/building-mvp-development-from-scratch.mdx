# Building MVP development from scratch

## What is MVP Development?

MVP development is the process of creating a product with the minimum set of features needed to validate your core business assumptions. It's not about building a basic version of your final product, but rather building the smallest possible thing that can prove or disprove your riskiest assumptions. The goal is learning, not launching.

## Why Should You Care?

Building an MVP helps you avoid wasting months or years building something nobody wants. Instead of investing heavily in features based on assumptions, you test your hypotheses quickly and cheaply. Successful companies like Dropbox, Airbnb, and Uber all started with simple MVPs that validated their core value propositions before scaling.

## Before You Start

### Prerequisites

- Clear problem statement and target customer definition
- Identified riskiest assumptions that need validation
- Basic understanding of your market and competitive landscape
- Access to potential early users for feedback

### What You'll Need

- Customer development skills for interviews and feedback collection
- Basic technical knowledge or access to development resources
- Analytics tools for measuring user behavior
- A mindset focused on learning over launching

## Step-by-Step Tutorial

### Step 1: Define Your Core Assumption

Start by identifying the single most important hypothesis your product needs to prove. Use this format: "We believe that [target customer] will [achieve outcome] by using [our solution] because [reason]."

For example: "We believe that freelance designers will find clients more efficiently by using our curated matching platform because it eliminates time spent on self-marketing."

### Step 2: Choose Your MVP Type

Select the appropriate MVP approach based on what you need to validate:

**Concierge MVP:** Manually deliver the service yourself to test demand before building automation
**Landing Page MVP:** Create a marketing page to measure interest and collect email signups
**Wizard of Oz MVP:** Build a frontend that appears automated but uses manual backend processes
**Piecemeal MVP:** Combine existing tools and services to create the experience without custom development

### Step 3: Map User Journey and Key Features

Identify the minimum steps a user must take to experience your core value proposition. Focus on the critical path that delivers the main benefit, ignoring nice-to-have features.

Create a feature matrix with three columns:

- **Must-have:** Features essential for core value delivery
- **Should-have:** Important but can be added later
- **Won't-have:** Features explicitly excluded from MVP

### Step 4: Build and Test Rapidly

Develop your MVP using the fastest possible approach. This might mean:

- No-code/low-code tools for web applications
- Simple mobile app builders for iOS/Android
- Manual processes for complex backend functionality
- Existing APIs and third-party integrations

Set a strict timeline (2-4 weeks maximum) and budget constraints to force focus on essentials.

### Step 5: Measure and Learn

Define success metrics before launch:

- **Activation rate:** Percentage of users who complete the core action
- **Retention:** Users who return within a specific timeframe
- **Satisfaction:** Qualitative feedback and NPS scores
- **Behavioral signals:** Actions indicating real value (not just curiosity)

Collect both quantitative data and qualitative feedback through interviews and surveys.

### Step 6: Iterate or Pivot

Based on your learning, decide whether to:

- **Persevere:** Continue refining the current approach
- **Pivot:** Change direction based on insights
- **Perish:** Abandon the idea if assumptions prove invalid

Document your learnings and use them to inform the next iteration or new hypothesis.

## What's Next?

After validating your core assumptions with an MVP, you can:

- Scale the product by adding features based on user feedback
- Expand to additional customer segments or use cases
- Optimize for growth and retention metrics
- Build out technical infrastructure for increased scale

Remember that MVP is not the end goal but the starting point for a continuous learning and improvement process.

## Common Questions

**Q: How do I know when my MVP is "done"?**
Your MVP is done when it can effectively validate or invalidate your core hypothesis. Don't focus on completeness; focus on learning capability.

**Q: Should I charge for my MVP?**
Yes, if possible. Paying customers provide the strongest validation of value. Even a small price filters out non-serious users and provides meaningful feedback.

**Q: What if my MVP looks unprofessional?**
Focus on function over appearance for early validation. However, ensure the core experience is polished enough that users can evaluate the value proposition without being distracted by rough edges.
