# How to conduct effective customer development interviews?

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Effective customer development interviews focus on understanding problems, not selling solutions. Prepare open-ended questions, listen 80% of the time, and avoid leading questions. Document patterns across interviews rather than individual opinions, and validate findings with quantitative data before making product decisions.

## Key Takeaways

- **Problem-focused questioning**: Ask about past behaviors and experiences rather than future intentions to get accurate insights
- **Listen more than you talk**: Follow the 80/20 rule where you listen 80% of the time and talk only 20%
- **Avoid solution bias**: Never mention your product idea during discovery interviews to prevent biased responses

## The Solution

Customer development interviews are structured conversations designed to uncover real user problems and validate product assumptions before building solutions. Unlike sales calls or user testing sessions, these interviews focus exclusively on understanding customer behaviors, pain points, and motivations. The key is to approach conversations with genuine curiosity, asking open-ended questions that reveal how people actually solve problems today, not how they think they might solve them tomorrow.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Prepare interview questions and hypothesis**
   Write 3-5 core assumptions about your customer's problems and create open-ended questions that test these assumptions without revealing your solution ideas.

2. **Recruit the right interview participants**
   Find 8-12 potential customers who match your target persona and have recently experienced the problem you're trying to solve.

3. **Conduct structured 30-minute interviews**
   Start with broad questions about their daily work, gradually narrow to specific problems, and always ask for concrete examples from past experiences.

4. **Synthesize patterns and insights**
   Review interview notes to identify recurring themes, contradictions, and unexpected insights across multiple participants before making product decisions.

## Common Questions

**Q: How many customer development interviews should I conduct?**
Aim for 8-12 interviews with your target audience. You'll typically start seeing patterns after 5-7 interviews, but continue until you're no longer learning new information.

**Q: Should I pay interview participants?**
Yes, compensate participants $50-100 for 30-45 minutes of their time. Payment ensures commitment and provides better quality insights than asking for favors.

**Q: What's the biggest mistake to avoid?**
Never mention your product idea or solution during discovery interviews. This immediately biases responses and prevents you from learning about real problems.
