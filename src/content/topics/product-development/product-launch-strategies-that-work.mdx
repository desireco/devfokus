# Product launch strategies that work

## Technical Overview

Successful product launches require systematic coordination across product, marketing, sales, and customer success teams. The most effective launches aren't single events but phased campaigns that build momentum, validate assumptions, and create sustainable growth engines. A well-executed launch strategy combines pre-launch buzz, coordinated launch activities, and post-launch optimization to maximize market impact.

## Architecture & Approach

### Launch Strategy Framework

Build your launch approach around four key phases:

**1. Pre-Launch Phase (6-8 weeks before launch)**

- Market validation and messaging refinement
- Internal team preparation and training
- Early adopter recruitment and beta testing
- Content creation and asset development

**2. Launch Phase (Launch week)**

- Coordinated announcement across channels
- Press and influencer outreach
- Customer onboarding and support preparation
- Performance monitoring and real-time optimization

**3. Post-Launch Phase (4-6 weeks after launch)**

- User feedback collection and analysis
- Performance optimization and iteration
- Expansion into additional channels
- Long-term growth strategy activation

**4. Sustained Growth Phase (Ongoing)**

- Continuous optimization based on data
- Feature expansion and product evolution
- Community building and advocacy programs
- Market expansion and scaling initiatives

### Launch Type Selection

Choose the appropriate launch strategy based on your goals:

**Big Bang Launch:** High-impact, high-investment launch for major products or new markets. Requires significant resources and coordination but can generate substantial awareness and adoption.

**Phased Rollout:** Gradual release to different user segments or geographic regions. Allows for learning and optimization but may reduce initial impact.

**Soft Launch:** Limited release to specific users or markets for validation before broader launch. Minimizes risk but requires patience and discipline.

**Continuous Deployment:** Ongoing feature releases without major launch events. Works well for SaaS products with regular updates.

## Common Questions

**Q: How much should I spend on a product launch?**
Launch budgets typically range from 10-30% of expected first-year revenue, depending on market competitiveness and growth goals. Focus spending on channels that reach your target audience most effectively.

**Q: When is the best time to launch a product?**
Consider seasonality, competitive landscape, and company readiness. Tuesday-Thursday launches typically perform better than Monday or Friday launches. Avoid major holidays or industry events unless they're relevant to your product.

**Q: How do I handle a launch that doesn't go as planned?**
Be transparent about issues, communicate clearly with customers, and focus on rapid problem resolution. Use challenges as opportunities to demonstrate customer commitment and build trust.
