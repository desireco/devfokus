# Quick Start Guide to Building Your First AI Agent

## What is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is a computer program that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike simple scripts, AI agents can adapt to changing conditions, learn from experience, and operate autonomously. Think of an AI agent as a digital assistant that can understand what you want, figure out how to get it done, and actually execute the steps needed to accomplish the task.

## Why Should You Care?

Building AI agents opens up incredible possibilities for automation, problem-solving, and innovation. You can create agents that analyze data, manage workflows, provide customer support, or even play games. Learning to build AI agents gives you skills that are in high demand and allows you to create solutions that can work 24/7 without getting tired or making mistakes from fatigue.

## Before You Start

### Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of functions and data structures
- Familiarity with command line/terminal
- Curiosity and willingness to experiment!

### What You'll Need

- Python 3.8 or higher installed
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Internet connection for installing packages
- About 2-3 hours to complete the tutorial

## Step-by-Step Tutorial

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

First, let's set up a Python environment and install the necessary packages for building AI agents.

```bash
# Create a new directory for your project
mkdir ai-agent-project
cd ai-agent-project

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv ai-agent-env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
ai-agent-env\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source ai-agent-env/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install langchain openai python-dotenv
```

### Step 2: Your First Simple Agent

Let's start with a basic agent that can have conversations and answer questions. Create a file called `simple_agent.py`:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

class SimpleAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the language model
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(
            model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            temperature=0.7,
            openai_api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        )

        # Define the agent's personality/instructions
        self.system_message = SystemMessage(
            content="You are a helpful AI assistant that provides clear, accurate, and thoughtful responses. Always consider the context of the conversation and try to be as helpful as possible."
        )

    def respond(self, user_input):
        """Generate a response to user input"""
        messages = [
            self.system_message,
            HumanMessage(content=user_input)
        ]

        response = self.llm(messages)
        return response.content

# Test your agent
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = SimpleAgent()

    print("Hello! I'm your first AI agent. Ask me anything!")
    print("Type 'quit' to exit.\n")

    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
            break

        response = agent.respond(user_input)
        print(f"Agent: {response}\n")
```

You'll need an OpenAI API key. Create a `.env` file in your project:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Now run your agent:

```bash
python simple_agent.py
```

### Step 3: Adding Memory

A good agent remembers previous conversations. Let's enhance our agent with memory:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage, AIMessage
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

load_dotenv()

class AgentWithMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(
            model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            temperature=0.7,
            openai_api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        )

        # Add memory to remember conversations
        self.memory = ConversationBufferMemory(
            memory_key="chat_history",
            return_messages=True
        )

        self.system_message = SystemMessage(
            content="You are a helpful AI assistant with excellent memory. Remember previous conversations and use that context when responding."
        )

    def respond(self, user_input):
        # Get conversation history
        chat_history = self.memory.chat_memory.messages

        # Create message list
        messages = [self.system_message] + chat_history + [HumanMessage(content=user_input)]

        # Generate response
        response = self.llm(messages)

        # Save to memory
        self.memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(user_input)
        self.memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(response.content)

        return response.content

# Test the agent with memory
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = AgentWithMemory()

    print("Hello! I'm an AI agent with memory. Talk to me!")
    print("Type 'quit' to exit.\n")

    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
            break

        response = agent.respond(user_input)
        print(f"Agent: {response}\n")
```

### Step 4: Creating a Task-Execution Agent

Now let's build an agent that can perform tasks and use tools:

```python
import os
import json
import requests
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage
from langchain.tools import Tool
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, AgentType

load_dotenv()

class TaskAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(
            model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            temperature=0.1,
            openai_api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        )

        # Define tools the agent can use
        self.tools = [
            Tool(
                name="Calculator",
                func=self.calculator,
                description="Useful for mathematical calculations"
            ),
            Tool(
                name="Weather",
                func=self.get_weather,
                description="Get current weather information for a city"
            ),
            Tool(
                name="Search",
                func=self.web_search,
                description="Search the internet for information"
            )
        ]

        # Initialize the agent with tools
        self.agent = initialize_agent(
            tools=self.tools,
            llm=self.llm,
            agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
            verbose=True
        )

    def calculator(self, expression):
        """Simple calculator tool"""
        try:
            # Safe evaluation of mathematical expressions
            result = eval(expression)
            return str(result)
        except:
            return "Error: Invalid mathematical expression"

    def get_weather(self, city):
        """Mock weather tool (you'd use a real weather API)"""
        # This is a mock - in reality you'd connect to a weather API
        mock_weather = {
            "New York": "72°F, Sunny",
            "London": "60°F, Cloudy",
            "Tokyo": "75°F, Partly cloudy",
            "Paris": "65°F, Rainy"
        }
        return mock_weather.get(city, f"Weather data not available for {city}")

    def web_search(self, query):
        """Mock search tool (you'd use a real search API)"""
        # This is a mock - in reality you'd connect to a search API
        return f"Search results for '{query}': This is where real search results would appear."

    def process_request(self, user_input):
        """Process a request using the agent"""
        return self.agent.run(user_input)

# Test the task agent
if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = TaskAgent()

    print("Hello! I'm a task-capable AI agent. I can calculate, check weather, and search!")
    print("Try asking me things like:")
    print("- 'What is 25 * 4 + 17?'")
    print("- 'What's the weather in New York?'")
    print("- 'Search for Python programming'")
    print("Type 'quit' to exit.\n")

    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
            break

        print("Agent thinking...")
        response = agent.process_request(user_input)
        print(f"Agent: {response}\n")
```

### Step 5: Adding Personality and Specialization

Let's create a specialized agent with a specific personality and purpose:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

load_dotenv()

class SpecializedAgent:
    def __init__(self, specialty="general"):
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(
            model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            temperature=0.7,
            openai_api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
        )

        self.specialty = specialty
        self.memory = ConversationBufferMemory(
            memory_key="chat_history",
            return_messages=True
        )

        # Define personality based on specialty
        self.personalities = {
            "teacher": "You are a patient and encouraging teacher. Break down complex topics into simple, understandable parts. Use examples and analogies to help students learn.",
            "creative": "You are a creative and artistic assistant. Help with brainstorming ideas, writing, and creative projects. Think outside the box and offer innovative solutions.",
            "technical": "You are a technical expert. Provide detailed, accurate technical information. Focus on best practices, code quality, and practical implementation.",
            "coach": "You are a motivational coach. Encourage users to reach their goals, provide actionable advice, and help them stay positive and focused."
        }

        self.system_message = SystemMessage(
            content=self.personalities.get(specialty, self.personalities["general"])
        )

    def respond(self, user_input):
        chat_history = self.memory.chat_memory.messages
        messages = [self.system_message] + chat_history + [HumanMessage(content=user_input)]

        response = self.llm(messages)

        self.memory.chat_memory.add_user_message(user_input)
        self.memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message(response.content)

        return response.content

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Choose your agent specialty:")
    print("1. Teacher")
    print("2. Creative")
    print("3. Technical")
    print("4. Coach")

    choice = input("Enter your choice (1-4): ")

    specialties = {
        "1": "teacher",
        "2": "creative",
        "3": "technical",
        "4": "coach"
    }

    specialty = specialties.get(choice, "general")
    agent = SpecializedAgent(specialty)

    print(f"\nHello! I'm your {specialty} AI assistant. How can I help you today?")
    print("Type 'quit' to exit.\n")

    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
            break

        response = agent.respond(user_input)
        print(f"Agent: {response}\n")
```

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need a powerful computer to build AI agents?**
No! Most AI agents run on cloud services through API calls. Your local computer just needs to handle the programming and internet connection.

**Q: How much does it cost to run AI agents?**
It varies based on the AI service you use. OpenAI's API costs a few cents per conversation, and many providers have free tiers for experimentation.

**Q: Can I build AI agents without paying for API keys?**
Yes! There are open-source models like Hugging Face transformers that can run locally, though they may be less capable than commercial APIs.

**Q: What if I get errors while running the code?**
Start with the simple agent and build up gradually. Common issues include missing API keys, internet connection problems, or package installation errors.
