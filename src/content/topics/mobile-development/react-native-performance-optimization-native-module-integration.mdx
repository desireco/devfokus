# React Native Performance: Optimization and Native Module Integration

## Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Optimize [React Native](/mobile-development/react-native-vs-flutter-vs-native-complete-framework-comparison) applications by implementing FlatList...

## Key Takeaways

- **List Optimization**: Use FlatList instead of ScrollView for large lists, implement getItemLayout for consistent item heights, and keyExtractor for stable list item identities
- **Native Modules**: Create custom native modules for performance-critical operations like image processing, cryptography, or hardware interactions
- **[Memory Management](/javascript/javascript-performance-memory-management-optimization-techniques)**: Enable Hermes JavaScript engine...
- **[Profiling Strategy](/performance-optimization/performance-profiling-complete-implementation-guide)**: Use Flipper for comprehensive performance analysis, implement custom performance metrics, and monitor production performance continuously

## The Solution

...understanding both [JavaScript](/javascript) runtime characteristics and native platform constraints. The bridge communication overhead between JavaScript and native code is a primary bottleneck that can be mitigated through careful architecture and native module implementation. By leveraging Hermes JavaScript engine, optimizing list rendering with FlatList, and implementing custom native modules for critical performance paths, you can achieve near-native performance while maintaining development efficiency. Continuous profiling and monitoring ensure performance remains optimal as your application scales and evolves.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Optimize Lists and Data Rendering**
   Implement FlatList with getItemLayout and keyExtractor, use React.memo for list item components, and implement data virtualization for large datasets.

2. **Implement Performance Monitoring**
   Set up Flipper for development profiling, implement custom performance metrics, and establish performance budgets for critical user flows.

3. **Create Native Modules for Critical Paths**
   Identify performance bottlenecks, implement custom native modules for CPU-intensive operations, and optimize bridge communication efficiently.

4. **Enable and Configure JavaScript Engine Optimizations**
   Enable Hermes JavaScript engine, configure Metro bundler for optimal bundle sizes, and implement code splitting for large applications.

## Common Questions

**Q: When should I create native modules vs optimize JavaScript code?**
Create native modules for CPU-intensive operations, hardware interactions, or when JavaScript optimization reaches its limits. Optimize JavaScript first for most business logic.

**Q: How do I measure the performance impact of optimizations?**
Use Flipper for development profiling, implement custom performance metrics in production, and establish baseline measurements before optimization.

**Q: What's the biggest performance bottleneck in React Native apps?**
Bridge communication overhead and inefficient list rendering are typically the biggest bottlenecks. Address these first for maximum performance gains.
